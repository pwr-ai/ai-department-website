 abstract = {Sequence prediction problem has been traditionally identified in the literature with sequence labeling. This approach typically corresponds to the classification of a label sequence associated to observed input sequence. However, another interpretation of sequence prediction may be considered where a label sequence (sequential output) is classified based only on the independent set of attributes. The paper presents a new, based on boosting, ensemble approach, performing such sequential output prediction. The sequential},
