 abstract = {The paper presents an algorithm of the automated wordnet expansion which can utilise results produced by both pattern-based and Distributional Similarity methods. It is based on the assumption that all relation extraction methods express some error, so we cannot identify the exact place (synset) for a new lemma on their bases, but an area (a wordnet subgraph). Support for a particular attachment point generated by knowledge should be expanded on the surrounding synsets. Moreover, the wordnet structure is modelled on the level of links},
