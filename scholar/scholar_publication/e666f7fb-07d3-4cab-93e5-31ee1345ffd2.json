Hence, there is a constant striving for optimizers capable of solving such problems effectively. In this paper, we examine the Multi-Objective Parameter-less Population Pyramid (MO-P3). MO-P3 is based on the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was dedicated to solving single-objective problems. P3 employs linkage learning to decompose the problem and uses this information during its run. P3 maintains many different linkage information sets, which is the", "pages": "41--42", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2021multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3449726.3462724", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", "0BoxJ6EAAAAJ", "AbH_p9kAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:bPhdFapzFIgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti-objective%2Bparameter-less%2Bpopulation%2Bpyramid%2Bin%2Bsolving%2Bthe%2Breal-world%2Band%2Btheoretical%2Bproblems%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=bPhdFapzFIgJ&ei=gcGgYdDZIcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0}
