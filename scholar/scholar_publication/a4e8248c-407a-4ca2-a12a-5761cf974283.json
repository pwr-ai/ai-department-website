    "abstract": "The problem of sequence prediction ie annotating sequences appears in many problems across a variety of scientific disciplines, especially in computational biology, natural language processing, speech recognition, etc. The paper investigates a boosting approach to structured prediction, AdaBoost STRUCT, based on proposed sequence-loss balancing function, combining advantages of boosting scheme with the efficiency of dynamic programming method. In the paper the method's formalism for modeling and predicting label",
