Information cascades are triggered when the activation of a set of initial nodes\u2013seeds\u2013results in diffusion to large number of nodes. Here, several novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the commonly used activation of all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation stages are introduced. Sequential strategies at later stages avoid seeding highly", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group", "pages": "1--11", "number": "1", "volume": "7", "journal": "Scientific reports", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "jankowski2017balancing"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00937-8", "author_id": ["xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "2OJOZTUAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:qSP88UxfwGQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DBalancing%2Bspeed%2Band%2Bcoverage%2Bby%2Bsequential%2Bseeding%2Bin%2Bcomplex%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=qSP88UxfwGQJ&ei=c56gYZrxEuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 37, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7259907383403226025&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:qSP88UxfwGQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Balancing+speed+and+coverage+by+sequential+seeding+in+complex+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00937-8"}
