Currently available morphological analysers for Polish cannot handle unknown words (not included in analyser's lexicon). Polish is a language with rich inflection, so comparing two words (even having the same lemma) is a non-trivial task. The aim of the similarity function is to match unknown word form with its word form in named-entity dictionary. In this article a complex similarity function is presented.
