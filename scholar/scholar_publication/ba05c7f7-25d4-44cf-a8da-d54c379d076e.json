In this study, we revised 55 off-the-shelf devices in recognition and analysis of emotion, stress, meditation, sleep, and physical activity, especially in field studies. Their usability directly comes from the types of sensors they possess as well as the quality and availability of raw signals. We found there is no versatile device suitable for all purposes.
