Many of them possess a networked nature and need to be processed and analysed as graph structures. Due to their size they very often require the usage of a parallel paradigm for efficient computation. Three parallel techniques have been compared in the paper: MapReduce, its map-side join extension and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP). They are implemented for two different graph problems: calculation of single source shortest paths", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "324--337", "volume": "32", "journal": "Future Generation Computer Systems", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2014parallel"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13001726", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "HvA-UicAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:O3uVdr3Eug8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DParallel%2Bprocessing%2Bof%2Blarge%2Bgraphs%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=O3uVdr3Eug8J&ei=Ar2gYYjtG8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 62, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1133434574254471995&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:O3uVdr3Eug8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Parallel+processing+of+large+graphs&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13001726"}
