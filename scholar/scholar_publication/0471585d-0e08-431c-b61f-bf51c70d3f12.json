The method is semi-automatic, because it requires that the character sequence constituting the word on the image is know. It is assumed that widths of the characters in the alphabet are random variables and that the parametres of probability distribution are specific for each character. At the first stage of the proposed method the parameters of the distributions for all alphabet characters are estimated. Then for each word in the corpus", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "485--492", "booktitle": "Computer Recognition Systems 2", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "sas2007semi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75175-5_61", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:SzyeLXkVtt8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSemi-automatic%2BHandwritten%2BWord%2BSegmentation%2BBased%2Bon%2BCharacter%2BWidth%2BApproximation%2BVia%2BMaximum%2BLikelihood%2BMethod%2Band%2BRegression%2BModel%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=SzyeLXkVtt8J&ei=IrygYfCrC4GEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16120095526419840075&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:SzyeLXkVtt8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Semi-automatic+Handwritten+Word+Segmentation+Based+on+Character+Width+Approximation+Via+Maximum+Likelihood+Method+and+Regression+Model&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Farshideh-Einsele/publication/227034062_Recognition_of_Ultra_Low_Resolution_Word_Images_Using_HMMs/links/558b294e08aee99ca9ca43aa/Recognition-of-Ultra-Low-Resolution-Word-Images-Using-HMMs.pdf#page=500"}
