The solution assumes the base multi-label classifiers to be a noisy channel and applies ECOCs in order to recover the classification errors made by individual classifiers. The framework was examined through exhaustive studies over combinations of three distinct classification algorithms and four ECOC methods employed in the multi-label classification problem.
