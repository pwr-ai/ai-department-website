The main aim of this work is to create a high-quality sentiment lexicon in a partially automated way. We propose a method called Classifier-based Polarity Propagation, which utilises a very rich set of wordnet-based features, to recognize and assign specific sentiment polarity values to wordnet senses. We have demonstrated that in comparison to the existing rule-base solutions using specific", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kocon2018classifier"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1665.pdf", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "UNlMg18AAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ungQgx9n8v4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DClassifier-based%2BPolarity%2BPropagation%2Bin%2Ba%2BWordnet%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ungQgx9n8v4J&ei=b8igYf-JIIiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 10, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=18370859215038216378&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:ungQgx9n8v4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Classifier-based+Polarity+Propagation+in+a+Wordnet&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1665.pdf"}
