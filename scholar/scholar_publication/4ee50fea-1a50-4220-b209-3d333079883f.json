Adopting the probabilistic model of diagnostic problem the rule-based decision algorithm with learning is presented. Proposed algorithm was applied practically to the diagnosis of acute renal failure in children. Obtained results have proved its effectiveness in the computer-aided medical decisionmaking.", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "287--290", "number": "2", "volume": "26", "journal": "IFAC Proceedings Volumes", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kurzynski1993rule"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474667017487337", "author_id": ["", "T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:1g3bfvNlZw8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRule-based%2Bmedical%2Bdecision-making%2Bwith%2Blearning%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=1g3bfvNlZw8J&ei=2pWgYfjGFOPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1109967929649860054&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:1g3bfvNlZw8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Rule-based+medical+decision-making+with+learning&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
