In the proposed, graph-based representation is constructed for sentences. Graphs are built on the basis of lexicalised syntactic-semantic relation extracted from text. Similarity between sentences is calculated from graph, and the similarity values are input to classifiers trained by Logistic Model Tree. Several different configurations of graph, as well as graph similarity methods were analysed for this tasks", "pages": "363--371", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2017", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kkedzia2017graph"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://aclanthology.org/R17-1048/", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "UNlMg18AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:2uM9zItlRZcJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DGraph-based%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Brecognizing%2Bcst%2Brelations%2Bin%2Bpolish%2Btexts%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=2uM9zItlRZcJ&ei=2JSgYeShLuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10900230124221621210&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:2uM9zItlRZcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Graph-based+approach+to+recognizing+cst+relations+in+polish+texts&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://aclanthology.org/R17-1048/"}
