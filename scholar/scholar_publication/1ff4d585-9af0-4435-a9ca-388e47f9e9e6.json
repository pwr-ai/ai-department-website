The core of the method is the construction of a statistical a tergo index, in which pseudo-suffixes (endings) extracted by a statistical tree define morpho-syntactic properties of corresponding word forms. The secondary aim was to investigate to what extent it is possible to develop the morphological analyses exclusively on the basis of", "organization": "Polish Information Processing Society", "pages": "247--256", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology\u20142nd International Symposium Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Applications (AAIA\u201907)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2007polish"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2007/pliks/150.pdf", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:efaeklb2qSoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPolish%2Bmorphological%2Bguesser%2Bbased%2Bon%2Ba%2Bstatistical%2Ba%2Btergo%2Bindex%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=efaeklb2qSoJ&ei=fa2gYZWpMuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 21, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3074259072344585849&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:efaeklb2qSoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Polish+morphological+guesser+based+on+a+statistical+a+tergo+index&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2007/pliks/150.pdf"}
