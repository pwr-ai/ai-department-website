On the other hand, the unsupervised methods express significantly lower accuracy and produce results that are not satisfying for many application. The goal of this work is to develop a model of Word Sense Disambiguation which minimises the amount of the required human intervention, but still assigns senses that come from a manually created lexical semantics resource, ie, a wordnet", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "17--24", "booktitle": "2009 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "broda2009semi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5352744/", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:bE3QQ2GHxQMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSemi-supervised%2Bword%2Bsense%2Bdisambiguation%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bweakly%2Bcontrolled%2Bsense%2Binduction%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=bE3QQ2GHxQMJ&ei=352gYdbHLumGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=271772204345085292&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:bE3QQ2GHxQMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Semi-supervised+word+sense+disambiguation+based+on+weakly+controlled+sense+induction&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2009/PTI/pliks/157.pdf"}
