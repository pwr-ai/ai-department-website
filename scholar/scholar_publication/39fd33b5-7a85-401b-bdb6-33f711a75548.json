In this article, we take a detailed look at the problem of modelling and optimization of aforementioned systems for k-nearest neighbour classifier. First, we present a comprehensive discussion on considered classification methods with a special focus on improving classification accuracy or response time through the use of partitions of original data set for the nearest neighbour rule.
