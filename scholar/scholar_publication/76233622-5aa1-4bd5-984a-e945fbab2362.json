In this work, we are investigating how well different seed selection strategies affect the spreading processes simulated using independent cascade model on eighteen multilayer social networks. Fifteen networks are built based on the user interaction data extracted from Facebook public pages and tree of them are multilayer networks downloaded from public repository (two of them being Twitter networks).
