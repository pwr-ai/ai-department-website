 abstract = {In this article some novel scheduling heuristics for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem have been proposed and compared to state-of-the-art priority rules, based on task duration, resource salaries and precedence relations. New heuristics stand an aggregation of known methods, but are enhanced by skills domain. The goal of the paper is to investigate, whether evaluated methods can be used as robustness enhancement tools in metaheuristics, mostly evolutionary algorithms. Experiments have been performed using},
