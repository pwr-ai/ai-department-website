The main result is the proposal of a method of language modelling which sequentially combines tri-grams of morphological base forms with tri-grams of words. The introduction of base form tri-grams increased the overall performance of the combined model, measured as the improvement in the accuracy of OCR of handwriting, as well, as the ability to generalisation.
