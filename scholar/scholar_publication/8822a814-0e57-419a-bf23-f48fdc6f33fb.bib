 abstract = {In this paper, we present Optimisation as a Service (OaaS) for an integrated process planning and scheduling in smart factories based on a distributed multi-criteria genetic algorithm (GA). In contrast to the traditional distributed GA following the island model, the proposed islands are executed asynchronously and exchange solutions at time points depending solely on the optimisation progress at each island. Several solutions' exchange strategies are proposed, implemented in Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes},
