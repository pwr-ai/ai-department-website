The method provides new features calculated by combination of both: network structure information and class labels assigned to nodes. The influence of various features on classification performance has also been studied. The experiments on real-world data have shown that features created owing to the proposed method can lead to significant improvement of classification accuracy.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "89--102", "booktitle": "International Conference on Social Informatics", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2010label"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16567-2_7", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:8efo233OICYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLabel-dependent%2Bfeature%2Bextraction%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%2Bfor%2Bnode%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=8efo233OICYJ&ei=op6gYfzMAbGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2747422812651710449&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:8efo233OICYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Label-dependent+feature+extraction+in+social+networks+for+node+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.0095"}
