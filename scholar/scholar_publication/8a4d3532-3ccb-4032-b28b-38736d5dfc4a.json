We present an unsupervised technique using Rhetorical Structure Theory and graph analysis. We evaluated our approach based on 100,000 reviews from Amazon and achieved an astonishing 80% coverage compared with human-generated hierarchies coded in ConceptNet. The method could be easily extended with a sentiment analysis model and used to describe sentiment", "pages": "1--5", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "augustyniak2018extracting"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3302425.3302479", "author_id": ["o3apDSYAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:EaRkXxCciOgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DExtracting%2BAspects%2BHierarchies%2Busing%2BRhetorical%2BStructure%2BTheory%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=EaRkXxCciOgJ&ei=b9SgYZKkF8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16755814007765771281&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:EaRkXxCciOgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Extracting+Aspects+Hierarchies+using+Rhetorical+Structure+Theory&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01800"}
