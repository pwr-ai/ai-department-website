    "abstract": "The growing volume of Internet traffic, increasing popularity of streaming services, and limited scalability of existing network techniques trigger the need to develop new delivery solutions based on a multicasting approach. Multicasting\u2014defined as a one-to-many delivery technique\u2014enables effective distribution of many kinds of content to end users. In this article we focus on peer-to-peer (P2P) multicasting, which combines concepts of P2P systems and multicasting solutions; in other words, the multicast tree is constructed using",
