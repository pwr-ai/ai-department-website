Such systems tend to produce many wrong suggestions. We propose a method of filtering a raw list of noun pairs potentially linked by hypernymy, and test it on Polish. The method aims for good recall and sufficient precision. The classifiers work with complex features that give clues on the relation between the nouns. We apply a corpus-based measure of semantic relatedness enhanced with a Rank Weight Function", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "393--404", "booktitle": "International Conference on Natural Language Processing", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2008classification"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85287-2_38", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", "aAk1SIsAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:YDuPG4-WKfgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DClassification-based%2Bfiltering%2Bof%2Bsemantic%2Brelatedness%2Bin%2Bhypernymy%2Bextraction%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=YDuPG4-WKfgJ&ei=AsCgYa7aHYbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17881989336838126432&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:YDuPG4-WKfgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Classification-based+filtering+of+semantic+relatedness+in+hypernymy+extraction&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rafael-Guzman-Cabrera/publication/273771443_Improving_Text_Classification_through_Web_Corpora/links/5e0238d2a6fdcc28373ce957/Improving-Text-Classification-through-Web-Corpora.pdf#page=403"}
