 abstract = {A corpus-based Measure of Semantic Relatedness can be calculated for every pair of words occurring in the corpus, but it can produce erroneous results for many word pairs due to accidental associations derived on the basis of several context features. We propose a novel idea of a partial measure that assigns relatedness values only to word pairs well enough supported by corpus data. Three simple implementations of this idea are presented and evaluated on large corpora and wordnets for two languages. Partial Measures of Semantic},
