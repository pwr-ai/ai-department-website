 abstract = {Self-organising Logic of Structures (SLS), a semantic representation language of high expressive power, seems attractive from a theoretical point of view. To check its usefulness for natural language understanding systems, an implementation is required. This article presents our efforts aimed at computational verification of SLS. We discuss some computational problems and propose a solution based on Constraint Logic Programming. An experimental implementation of a modelchecker for dynamic formulae is presented. It},
