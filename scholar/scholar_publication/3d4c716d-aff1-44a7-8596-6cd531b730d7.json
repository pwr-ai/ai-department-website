We evaluate modularity-maximizing using fast greedy and leading eigenvector approximations, infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. For this purpose, we propose to construct a label co-occurrence graph (both weighted and unweighted versions) based on training data and", "publisher": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute", "pages": "282", "number": "8", "volume": "18", "journal": "Entropy", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "szymanski2016data"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/150182", "author_id": ["K8v7ROIAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "QY-earAAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:HGMbKHbMILAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHow%2Bis%2Ba%2Bdata-driven%2Bapproach%2Bbetter%2Bthan%2Brandom%2Bchoice%2Bin%2Blabel%2Bspace%2Bdivision%2Bfor%2Bmulti-label%2Bclassification%253F%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=HGMbKHbMILAJ&ei=ipqgYdmnEemGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 42, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12691368557781148444&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:HGMbKHbMILAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=How+is+a+data-driven+approach+better+than+random+choice+in+label+space+division+for+multi-label+classification%3F&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/8/282/htm"}
