Recognition of the Proper Names (PN) is treated as the basis for Named Entity Recognition problem in general. The proposed method is based on combining domain-dependent method based on HMM with domain independent methods based on gazetteers and hand-written rules for recognition and post-processing that capture the general properties of Polish PN structure.
