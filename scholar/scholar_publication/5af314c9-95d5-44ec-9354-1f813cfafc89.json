    "abstract": "A common problem of the real-world data sets is the class imbalance, which can significantly affect the classification abilities of classifiers. Numerous methods have been proposed to cope with this problem; however, even state-of-the-art methods offer a limited improvement (if any) for data sets with critically under-represented minority classes. For such problematic cases, an \u201coutside the box\u201d solution is required. Therefore, we propose a novel technique, called enrichment, which uses the information (observations) from the external data set (s)",
