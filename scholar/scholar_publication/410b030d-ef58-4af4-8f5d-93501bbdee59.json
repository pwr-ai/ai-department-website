However, the new technologies bring up new computation problems as well. The network flow may be organized in a better way with respect to different criteria. It is common that such problems are hard not only because of their size, but also due to their NP-complete or NP-hard nature. The Genetic Algorithms are commonly known and widely used tools, which allow to effectively solve such problems.
