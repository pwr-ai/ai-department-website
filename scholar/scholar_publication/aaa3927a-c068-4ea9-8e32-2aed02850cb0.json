Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented, human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques are not applicable to human-human dialogs", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.07888", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "zelasko2019towards"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07888", "author_id": ["5YUtDtEAAAAJ", "kV8W150AAAAJ", "UwvCguQAAAAJ", "fNqZL_4AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:j4vIaeBR-YMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTowards%2BBetter%2BUnderstanding%2Bof%2BSpontaneous%2BConversations:%2BOvercoming%2BAutomatic%2BSpeech%2BRecognition%2BErrors%2BWith%2BIntent%2BRecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=j4vIaeBR-YMJ&ei=YaygYeTlIcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:j4vIaeBR-YMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Towards+Better+Understanding+of+Spontaneous+Conversations:+Overcoming+Automatic+Speech+Recognition+Errors+With+Intent+Recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07888"}
