To check its usefulness for natural language understanding systems, an implementation is required. This article presents our efforts aimed at computational verification of SLS. We discuss some computational problems and propose a solution based on Constraint Logic Programming. An experimental implementation of a modelchecker for dynamic formulae is presented.
