 abstract = {The main goal of the paper is to present that word's sentiment can be discovered from propagation through well-defined word networks such as Word–Net. Therefore a new method for propagation of sentiment from a given word seed-Micro-WNOp corpus over the word network (WordNet 3.0) has been proposed and evaluated. The experimental studies proved that WordNet has a great potential in sentiment propagation, even if types of links (eg hyponymy, heteronymy etc.) and semantic meaning of words are not taken into},
