 abstract = {Evolutionary methods are well-known tools used for solving hard computational problems. In this paper, we consider k-Shortest Steiner Trees (kSST) problem appearing in a diverse set of domains, eg, multicast tree construction in communication networks in general, and optical networks in particular. The kSST is relatively new and has not been widely investigated in the literature. Thus, only a few algorithms have been proposed, each requiring significant resources amount and long execution times, partially following from the},
