The ultimate aim is to create the set of isolated character images used as a training set for the writer-dependent handwriting recognizer. Analytic approach is applied, where word recognition is based on the individual classification of characters. The input to the proposed segmentation method is a handwritten text image consisting of known words. The method consists of three stages. Initially, images of isolated words are over", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "226--244", "volume": "191", "journal": "Information Sciences", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2012similarity"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025511006724", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", "A3zYitkAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:AlHLgWlsxFkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSimilarity-based%2Btraining%2Bset%2Bacquisition%2Bfor%2Bcontinuous%2Bhandwriting%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=AlHLgWlsxFkJ&ei=iaygYYOjMePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6468414165215826178&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:AlHLgWlsxFkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Similarity-based+training+set+acquisition+for+continuous+handwriting+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
