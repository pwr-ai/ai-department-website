The advances in representation on graphs have centered on both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, where the latter presenting the challenges associated with multi-typed nodes and/or edges. In this paper, we consider the additional challenge of evolving graphs. We ask the question of whether the advances in representation learning for static graphs can be", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "107453", "journal": "Knowledge-Based Systems", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "bielak2021fildne"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705121007152", "author_id": ["Z0lkjn0AAAAJ", "", "08jtE7MAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:jRJ6IhqtZ-kJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DFILDNE:%2BA%2BFramework%2Bfor%2BIncremental%2BLearning%2Bof%2BDynamic%2BNetworks%2BEmbeddings%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=jRJ6IhqtZ-kJ&ei=65WgYfuPE-mGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:jRJ6IhqtZ-kJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=FILDNE:+A+Framework+for+Incremental+Learning+of+Dynamic+Networks+Embeddings&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03423"}
