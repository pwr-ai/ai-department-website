 abstract = {1.2. The intersection of any family of a-algebras on X is again a a-algebra. If A is any collection  of subsets of X, then the intersection of all the a-algebras on X which contain the collection is  again a a-algebra. It is the smallest a-algebra containing A. It is called the a-algebra generated},
