We discuss the organisation of the project, the fundamental assumptions, the tools and the resources. We show how our work differs from that done on EuroWordNet and BalkaNet. In a year we expect the network to reach 20000 lexical units. Some 12000 entries will have been completed by hand. Work on others will be automated as far as possible; to that end, we have developed statistics-based semantic similarity functions and methods based on a form of chunking.
