The proposed representation is not dependent on the remote ascription (ie done outside the formal representation) of syntactic indexes, which identify anaphoric links. A formal language of variable free logic is introduced. It is based on dynamic semantics paradigm and is a variant of many-sorted type logic. We will also present the scope free treatment of quantification in multiple quantifier sentences.
