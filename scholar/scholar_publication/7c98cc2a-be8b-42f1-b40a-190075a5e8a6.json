In this paper we investigate the impact of underlying text representation on the performance of neural classification models in the task of Brand-Product relation extraction. We also present the methodology of preparing annotated textual corpora for this task and we provide valuable insight into the properties of Brand-Product relations existing in textual corpora. The problem is approached from a practical angle of applications Relation Extraction in facilitating commercial Internet", "pages": "1895--1901", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "janz2020brand"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.233/", "author_id": ["UNlMg18AAAAJ", "", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ashG-0aiSGIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DBrand-Product%2BRelation%2BExtraction%2BUsing%2BHeterogeneous%2BVector%2BSpace%2BRepresentations%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ashG-0aiSGIJ&ei=9amgYdqrDumGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:ashG-0aiSGIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Brand-Product+Relation+Extraction+Using+Heterogeneous+Vector+Space+Representations&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.lrec-1.233.pdf"}
