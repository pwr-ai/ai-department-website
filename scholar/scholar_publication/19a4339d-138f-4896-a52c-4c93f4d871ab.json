In this method different probabilistic character language models (PCLMs) are used in order to improve the word recognition accuracy. These models consist of conditional probability distributions of characters given that preceding, succeeding or surrounding characters are known. The application of character succession and precedence in word recognition was explored in many earlier works. The novelty of the method proposed here consists in utilizing also the", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "477--484", "booktitle": "Computer Recognition Systems 2", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "sas2007handwritten"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-75175-5_60", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:DUC7DvM7O7MJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHandwritten%2BWord%2BRecognition%2Bwith%2BCombined%2BClassifier%2BBased%2Bon%2BTri-grams%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,10&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=DUC7DvM7O7MJ&ei=zJigYfyLOIiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12914982271525273613&as_sdt=40005&sciodt=0,10&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:DUC7DvM7O7MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Handwritten+Word+Recognition+with+Combined+Classifier+Based+on+Tri-grams&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10", "eprint_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/51997189/Recognition_of_Ultra_Low_Resolution_Word20170302-27251-1he3p0c.pdf#page=492"}
