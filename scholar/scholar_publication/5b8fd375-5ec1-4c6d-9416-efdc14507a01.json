The attempt resulted in experimental system that can be used as a tool for practical applications. The system uses a typical recognition method based on Hidden Markov Model and domain-specific language model. Implemented software made it possible to conduct many experiments aimed on evaluation of the assumed approach usefulness. Obtained experiment results are presented and analyzed.
