Unfortunately, entropy and all entropy-based information-theoretic measures have several vulnerabilities. These measures neither are independent of a particular representation of the network nor can capture the properties of the generative process, which produces the network. Instead, we advocate the use of the algorithmic entropy as the basis for complexity", "publisher": "Hindawi", "volume": "2017", "journal": "Complexity", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "morzy2017measuring"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/3250301/", "author_id": ["UwvCguQAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Cw-chhfqgEEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DOn%2BMeasuring%2Bthe%2BComplexity%2Bof%2BNetworks:%2BKolmogorov%2BComplexity%2Bversus%2BEntropy%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=Cw-chhfqgEEJ&ei=RpagYaawLoiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4720029796247801611&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Cw-chhfqgEEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=On+Measuring+the+Complexity+of+Networks:+Kolmogorov+Complexity+versus+Entropy&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.hindawi.com/journals/complexity/2017/3250301/"}
