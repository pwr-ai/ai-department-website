 abstract = {Many real-world problems are notoriously multi-objective and NP-hard. Hence, there is a constant striving for optimizers capable of solving such problems effectively. In this paper, we examine the Multi-Objective Parameter-less Population Pyramid (MO-P3). MO-P3 is based on the Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) that was dedicated to solving single-objective problems. P3 employs linkage learning to decompose the problem and uses this information during its run. P3 maintains many different linkage information sets, which is the},
