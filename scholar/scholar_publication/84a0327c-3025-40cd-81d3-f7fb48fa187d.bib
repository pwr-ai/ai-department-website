 abstract = {Paper presents a hybrid Differential Evolution and Greedy Algorithm (DEGR) applied to solve Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. The specialized indirect representation and transformation of solution space from discrete (typical for this problem), to continuous (typical for DE-approaches) are proposed and examined. Furthermore, Taguchi Design of Experiments method has been used to adjust parameters for investigated method to reduce the procedure of experiments. Finally, various},
