    "abstract": "Wearables equipped with pervasive sensors enable us to monitor physiological and behavioral signals. In this study, we revised 55 off-the-shelf devices in recognition and analysis of emotion, stress, meditation, sleep, and physical activity, especially in field studies. Their usability directly comes from the types of sensors they possess as well as the quality and availability of raw signals. We found there is no versatile device suitable for all purposes. Empatica E4 and Microsoft Band 2 are good at emotion, stress, and together with",
