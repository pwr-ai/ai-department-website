 abstract = {Though the interest in use of wordnets for lexicography is (gradually) growing, no research has been conducted so far on equivalence between lexical units (or senses) in inter-linked wordnets. In this paper, we present and validate a procedure of sense-linking between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet. The proposed procedure employs a continuum of three equivalence types: strong, regular and weak, distinguished by a custom-designed set of formal, semantic and translational features. To validate the procedure, three independent},
