As plWordNet construction had started from scratch it was necessary to find a way to reduce the amount of work required, and not to reduce the quality. In the paper we discuss the gained experience in applying different tools based on Distributional Semantics methods to support the work of lexicographers. A special attention is given to the Paintball algorithm for semiautomated wordnet expansion and its application in the", "pages": "41--56", "number": "1", "volume": "25", "journal": "Computational Methods in Science and Technology", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "piasecki2019paintball"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://cmst.eu/wp-content/uploads/files/10.12921_cmst.2018.0000051_PIASECKI.pdf", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 1, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:6RaoM6W0LqMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPaintball:%2BAutomated%2Bwordnet%2Bexpansion%2Balgorithm%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bdistributional%2Bsemantics%2Band%2Binformation%2Bspreading%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=6RaoM6W0LqMJ&ei=UcFdYaeBHsKSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=11758534298740201193&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:6RaoM6W0LqMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Paintball:+Automated+wordnet+expansion+algorithm+based+on+distributional+semantics+and+information+spreading&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://cmst.eu/wp-content/uploads/files/10.12921_cmst.2018.0000051_PIASECKI.pdf"}
