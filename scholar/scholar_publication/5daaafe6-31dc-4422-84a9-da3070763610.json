Following its basis, MorphoiTa-pl utilises a rich feature averaged perceptron neural network for morphological analysis and morpho-syntactic disambiguation of the Polish language and produces results in the National Corpus of Polish (NCP) tagset. MorphoLiTa-pl performance represents the state of the art for Polish.
