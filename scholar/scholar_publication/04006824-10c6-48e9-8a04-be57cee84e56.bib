 abstract = {WebSty is an open, web-based stylometric system designed for Social Sciences & Humanities (SS&H) users. It was designed according to the CLARIN philosophy: no need for installation, minimised requirements on the users' technical skills and knowledge, and focus on SS&H tasks. In the paper, we present its latest extension with several visualisation methods, techniques for the extraction of characteristic features, and support for multilinguality.},
