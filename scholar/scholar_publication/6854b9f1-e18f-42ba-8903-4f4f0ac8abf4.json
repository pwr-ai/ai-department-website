The architecture is based on both the general paradigm of the service-oriented architecture, client-server approach and strong separation of concerns between storage and processing components. An experimental IE system, named Semanta, utilising the proposed architecture is also presented. In the following document, we describe five main Semanta services, which are", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "61--66", "booktitle": "5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "jastrzebski2005distributed"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1578761/", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 2, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:fako0QlP1OgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DDistributed%2Bservice-oriented%2Barchitecture%2Bfor%2Binformation%2Bextraction%2Bsystem%2522%2BSemanta%2522%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=fako0QlP1OgJ&ei=JMFdYZjwJ8KSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16777121415444343165&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:fako0QlP1OgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Distributed+service-oriented+architecture+for+information+extraction+system%22+Semanta%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
