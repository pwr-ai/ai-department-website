 abstract = {A social network (SN) is a network containing nodesâ€“social entities (people or groups of people) and links between these nodes. Social networks are examples of more general concept of complex networks and SNs are usually free-scale and have power distribution of node degree. Overall, several types of social networks can be enumerated:(i) simple SNs,(ii) multi-layered SNs (with many links between a pair of nodes),(iii) bipartite or multi-modal, heterogeneous SNs (with two or many different types of nodes),(iv) multidimensional SNs},
