Until now, the major obstacle for curriculum methods was the lack of a reliable method for estimating the difficulty of training instances. In this paper we show that, instead of trying to assess the difficulty of learning instances, a simple graph-based method of computing the typicality of instances can be used in conjunction with curriculum methods", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "279--291", "booktitle": "International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "krysinska2021curriculum"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-86380-7_23", "author_id": ["", "UwvCguQAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:hn99h8jJuSMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCurriculum%2BLearning%2BRevisited:%2BIncremental%2BBatch%2BLearning%2Bwith%2BInstance%2BTypicality%2BRanking%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=hn99h8jJuSMJ&ei=saGgYdP5A-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 0}
