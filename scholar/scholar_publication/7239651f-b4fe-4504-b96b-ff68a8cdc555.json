Therefore a new method for propagation of sentiment from a given word seed-Micro-WNOp corpus over the word network (WordNet 3.0) has been proposed and evaluated. The experimental studies proved that WordNet has a great potential in sentiment propagation, even if types of links (eg hyponymy, heteronymy etc.) and semantic meaning of words are not taken into", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "263--272", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "misiaszek2014belief"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-05458-2_28", "author_id": ["", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:jLAMw0hLDvQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DBelief%2BPropagation%2BMethod%2Bfor%2BWord%2BSentiment%2Bin%2BWordNet%2B3.0%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=jLAMw0hLDvQJ&ei=8Z2gYbj8N8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17586076370810482828&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:jLAMw0hLDvQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Belief+Propagation+Method+for+Word+Sentiment+in+WordNet+3.0&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
