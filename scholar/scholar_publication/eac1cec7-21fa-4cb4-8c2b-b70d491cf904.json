As it has been shown, it is a NP-hard problem, so since than some heuristics were proposed as suboptimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used assumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the temporal one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks, where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of time.
