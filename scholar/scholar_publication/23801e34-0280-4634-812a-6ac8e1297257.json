On the other hand, the unsupervised methods express significantly lower accuracy and produce results that are not satisfying for many application. Recently, an algorithm based on weakly-supervised learning for WSD called Lexicographer-Controlled Semi-automatic Sense Disambiguation (LexCSD) was proposed. The method is based on clustering of text snippets", "journal": "Proceedings of Intelligent Information Systems", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "broda2010evaluating"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/31031414/iis10-08.pdf", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ebUg1L6AmZgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEvaluating%2BLexCSD%25E2%2580%2594a%2Bweakly-supervised%2Bmethod%2Bon%2Bimproved%2Bsemantically%2Bannotated%2Bcorpus%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bscale%2Bexperiment%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ebUg1L6AmZgJ&ei=sNOgYbL2I4GUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10995961522292831609&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:ebUg1L6AmZgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Evaluating+LexCSD%E2%80%94a+weakly-supervised+method+on+improved+semantically+annotated+corpus+in+a+large+scale+experiment&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/31031414/iis10-08.pdf"}
