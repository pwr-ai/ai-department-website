The method provides functionality for repayment value prediction over time that describes the recovery profile of the debt portfolio. Experimental studies on hybrid combination of various data mining methods like clustering and decision trees into one complex process revealed usefulness of the proposed method for claim appraisals.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "850--857", "booktitle": "International Conference on Computational Collective Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2009hybrid"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04441-0_74", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:2bXFom-ef-YJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHybrid%2Brepayment%2Bprediction%2Bfor%2Bdebt%2Bportfolio%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=2bXFom-ef-YJ&ei=uNOgYemvBIGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16609168153075103193&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:2bXFom-ef-YJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Hybrid+repayment+prediction+for+debt+portfolio&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
