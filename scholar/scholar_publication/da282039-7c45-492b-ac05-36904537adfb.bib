 abstract = {Since its inception a quarter century ago, Princeton WordNet [PWN](Miller 1995; Fellbaum 1998) has had a profound influence on research and applications in lexical semantics, computational linguistics and natural language processing. The numerous uses of this lexical resource have motivated the building of wordnets 1 in several dozen languages, including even a ''dead''language, Latin. This special issue looks at certain aspects of wordnet construction and organisation. There are diverse methods of wordnet construction},
