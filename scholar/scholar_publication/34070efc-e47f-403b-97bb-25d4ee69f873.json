The temporal information extracted from the text plays major role in many information extraction systems, like question answering, event recognition or discourse analysis. We proposed a new method for the temporal expressions normalisation, called Cascade of Partial Rules. Here we describe results achieved by updated version of Liner2 machine learning system.", "pages": "387--393", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing, RANLP 2017", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kocon2017improved"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R17-1051/", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "aAk1SIsAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:wYufWYPN8S0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DImproved%2BRecognition%2Band%2BNormalisation%2Bof%2BPolish%2BTemporal%2BExpressions%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=wYufWYPN8S0J&ei=9KOgYe2-O4iKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3310653165122063297&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:wYufWYPN8S0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Improved+Recognition+and+Normalisation+of+Polish+Temporal+Expressions&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
