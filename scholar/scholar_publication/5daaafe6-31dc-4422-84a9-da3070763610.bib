 abstract = {We present a new morpho-syntactic tagger for Polish called MorphoIXTa-pl, which is based on the adaptation of the MorphoIiTa tagger developed originally for the Czech language. Following its basis, MorphoiTa-pl utilises a rich feature averaged perceptron neural network for morphological analysis and morpho-syntactic disambiguation of the Polish language and produces results in the National Corpus of Polish (NCP) tagset. MorphoLiTa-pl performance represents the state of the art for Polish. However, contrary to other taggers, it is a complete},
