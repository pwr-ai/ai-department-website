    "abstract": "Association rules are often utilized in Web recommendation systems for creation of suggested items lists. However, lists obtained in this way may be too short. Indirect association rules are introduced to extend classical, direct association rules and supplement the knowledge they contribute. The relation between ranking lists created on the basis of association rules and hyperlinks existing on Web pages has also been examined in the paper.",
