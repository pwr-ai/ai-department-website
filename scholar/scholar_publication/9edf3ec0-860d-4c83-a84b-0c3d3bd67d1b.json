The focus of representation learning on graphs has focused mainly on shallow (node-centric) or deep (graph-based) learning approaches. While there have been approaches that work on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with multi-typed nodes and edges, there is a gap in learning edge representations", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14727", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "bielak2020attre2vec"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14727", "author_id": ["Z0lkjn0AAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "hDLBEhkAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:avZLlneOBmIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAttrE2vec:%2BUnsupervised%2BAttributed%2BEdge%2BRepresentation%2BLearning%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=avZLlneOBmIJ&ei=EZSgYYHsPLGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:avZLlneOBmIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=AttrE2vec:+Unsupervised+Attributed+Edge+Representation+Learning&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14727"}
