 abstract = {The paper presents the strategy of mapping plWordNet to Princeton WordNet and explores its potential applications in translation practice. The very concept of wordnet is shortly described, together with the pecularities of the structure (and underlying methodology) of Princeton WordNet and plWordNet. We introduce a set of hierarchically ordered inter-lingual relations and the mapping procedure used for the linking of the two wordnets. Next, the role of those inter-lingual relations in finding translation equivalents is discussed.},
