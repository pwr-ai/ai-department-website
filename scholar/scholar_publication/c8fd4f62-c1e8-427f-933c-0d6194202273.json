Moreover, we can see significant gains in expanding the knowledge domain, increasing prediction quality, and reducing the inference time. New developments in cross-lingual knowledge transfer open up a range of possibilities, particularly in working with low-resource languages. With a motivation to explore the latest subfields of natural language processing and their interactions, we decided to create a multi", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "gawrondeep"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://sentic.net/sentire2021gawron.pdf", "author_id": ["", "k5HZbewAAAAJ", "GCVNVWYAAAAJ", "9IwA_bYAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:csTJ4H7d3FIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DDeep%2BNeural%2BLanguage-agnostic%2BMulti-task%2BText%2BClassifier%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=csTJ4H7d3FIJ&ei=_aKgYcXbIOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 0, "eprint_url": "https://sentic.net/sentire2021gawron.pdf"}
