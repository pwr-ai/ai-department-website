The relevance of these methodologies is motivated by their power of being able to express knowledge contained in data sets in multiple ways, benefiting each of the other, ie, exploiting their diversity, thus increasing the performance of sole base models in terms of model accuracy and generalization capability by intelligent combination strategies, especially while dealing with", "publisher": "Springer", "pub_type": "misc", "bib_id": "kazienko2015editorial"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-015-1916-x", "author_id": ["cxLgNccAAAAJ", "G6sMKIkAAAAJ", "f3gKG3kAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 7, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:jQ8JkAv7k-QJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEditorial%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bspecial%2Bissue%2B%25E2%2580%259CHybrid%2Band%2Bensemble%2Btechniques%2Bin%2Bsoft%2Bcomputing:%2Brecent%2Badvances%2Band%2Bemerging%2Btrends%25E2%2580%259D%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=jQ8JkAv7k-QJ&ei=-z5eYf-CMM-TmwHPvZGABQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16470784289303760781&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:jQ8JkAv7k-QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Editorial+on+the+special+issue+%E2%80%9CHybrid+and+ensemble+techniques+in+soft+computing:+recent+advances+and+emerging+trends%E2%80%9D&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-015-1916-x"}
