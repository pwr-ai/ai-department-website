However, another relevant problem is solved in the paper instead of individual link forecasting: prediction of key network measures values, what is a more time saving approach. Two machine learning techniques were examined: time series forecasting and classification. Both of them were tested on two real-life social network", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "1056--1059", "booktitle": "2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "michalski2012predicting"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6425619/", "author_id": ["xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:DG_KFZKG9PYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPredicting%2BSocial%2BNetwork%2BMeasures%2Busing%2BMachine%2BLearning%2BApproach%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=DG_KFZKG9PYJ&ei=ypWgYaHiA4GEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 20, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17794995989636607756&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:DG_KFZKG9PYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Predicting+Social+Network+Measures+using+Machine+Learning+Approach&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~michalski/publications/pub_2012_csna.pdf"}
