The algorithm is a modification of Algorithm of Activation-area Attachment used for wordnet expansion. Evidence provided by different knowledge sources is analysed on the level of lexical units and their location in the wordnet structure. Influence of each knowledge source on the local context can be tuned to its characteristics. The algorithm was applied to a large set of Polish Proper Names and a set of heterogeneous", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kurcautomated"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/290274860_Automated_mapping_of_polish_proper_names_on_PlWordNet_Hypernymy_structure/links/59eaf5760f7e9bfdeb6ce0cd/Automated-mapping-of-polish-proper-names-on-PlWordNet-Hypernymy-structure.pdf", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 0, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:l1kkntujmwQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomated%2BMapping%2Bof%2BPolish%2BProper%2BNames%2Bon%2BplWordNet%2BHypernymy%2BStructure%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=l1kkntujmwQJ&ei=fy9eYdDvNofBmQGX-6OoBg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:l1kkntujmwQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automated+Mapping+of+Polish+Proper+Names+on+plWordNet+Hypernymy+Structure&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/290274860_Automated_mapping_of_polish_proper_names_on_PlWordNet_Hypernymy_structure/links/59eaf5760f7e9bfdeb6ce0cd/Automated-mapping-of-polish-proper-names-on-PlWordNet-Hypernymy-structure.pdf"}
