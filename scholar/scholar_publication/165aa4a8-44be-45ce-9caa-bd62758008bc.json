Different versions of the extraction of semantic similarity measures from a corpus are analysed, with the best results achieved for the combination of the text window context and Rank Weight Function. An algorithm of the word sequence selection with the high internal similarity is proposed. The method was trained and applied to a corpus of real medical documents written in Polish.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "437--446", "booktitle": "International conference on Intelligent data engineering and automated learning", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "broda2007correction"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-77226-2_45", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:gh07DoNzq-QJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCorrection%2Bof%2Bmedical%2Bhandwriting%2BOCR%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bsemantic%2Bsimilarity%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=gh07DoNzq-QJ&ei=XKWgYYfPHuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16477390668381756802&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:gh07DoNzq-QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Correction+of+medical+handwriting+OCR+based+on+semantic+similarity&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/ideal/ideal2007/BrodaP07.pdf"}
