We introduce a sense-level emotive lexicon annotated with polarity, arousal and emotions. The data were annotated as a part of a large study involving over 20,000 participants. A total of 30,000 lexical units in Polish WordNet were described with metadata, each unit received about 50 annotations concerning polarity, arousal and 8 basic emotions, marked on a multilevel scale. We present a preliminary approach to propagating", "pages": "336--341", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 10th Global Wordnet Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kocon2019propagation"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2019.gwc-1.43/", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "UNlMg18AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:aK4tJhlp_AUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPropagation%2Bof%2Bemotions,%2Barousal%2Band%2Bpolarity%2Bin%2BWordNet%2Busing%2BHeterogeneous%2BStructured%2BSynset%2BEmbeddings%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=aK4tJhlp_AUJ&ei=2qygYbLSCOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=431335221056351848&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:aK4tJhlp_AUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Propagation+of+emotions,+arousal+and+polarity+in+WordNet+using+Heterogeneous+Structured+Synset+Embeddings&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2019.gwc-1.43.pdf"}
