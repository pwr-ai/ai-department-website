 abstract = {The advancement of science, as outlined by Popper and Kuhn, is largely qualitative, but with bibliometric data, it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative picture of scientific progress. Furthermore, it is also important to allocate finite resources to research topics that have the growth potential to accelerate the process from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic},
