The construction of the system is discussed, but also examples of different applications showing the potential of supermatrix are given. The core of the system is construction of co-incidence matrices from corpora written in any natural language as the system works on UTF-8 encoding and possesses modular construction. Supermatrix follows the general scheme of distributional", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "345--352", "booktitle": "2008 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "broda2008supermatrix"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4747263/", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 25, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:bOlkF_TbUxEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSuperMatrix:%2Ba%2Bgeneral%2Btool%2Bfor%2Blexical%2Bsemantic%2Bknowledge%2Bacquisition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=bOlkF_TbUxEJ&ei=rbBdYYD4FaPZsQKvo78o", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1248583363122751852&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:bOlkF_TbUxEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=SuperMatrix:+a+general+tool+for+lexical+semantic+knowledge+acquisition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.157.9943&rep=rep1&type=pdf"}
