However, producing evidence of sufficient quantity and quality is hampered by the high cost and complexity of conducting research, the numbers of clinicians and patients willing to participate in clinical trials. The Learning Healthcare System initiative creates routes for knowledge transfer between different parts of the health system, thereby increasing its research and learning capacity. This effort is closely aligned with initiatives such as CDISC", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "3176--3185", "booktitle": "2015 48th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "lim2015transform"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7070198/", "author_id": ["fLBb2iMAAAAJ", "", "", "X9VrDxkAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:r74e5NtXO7EJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTRANSFoRm:%2BImplementing%2Ba%2BLearning%2BHealthcare%2BSystem%2Bin%2BEurope%2Bthrough%2Bembedding%2Bclinical%2Bresearch%2Binto%2Bclinical%2Bpractice%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=r74e5NtXO7EJ&ei=XcigYd_MAePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12770897770275847855&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:r74e5NtXO7EJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=TRANSFoRm:+Implementing+a+Learning+Healthcare+System+in+Europe+through+embedding+clinical+research+into+clinical+practice&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Francois-Ethier/publication/270394977_TRANSFoRm_Implementing_a_Learning_Healthcare_System_in_Europe_through_Embedding_Clinical_Research_into_Clinical_Practice/links/54a998650cf2eecc56e6c588/TRANSFoRm-Implementing-a-Learning-Healthcare-System-in-Europe-through-Embedding-Clinical-Research-into-Clinical-Practice.pdf"}
