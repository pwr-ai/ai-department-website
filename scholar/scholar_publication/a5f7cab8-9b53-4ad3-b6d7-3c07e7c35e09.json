We hope that theory and successful  applications presented at the AAIA'14 will be of interest to researchers and practitioners who  want to know about both theoretical advances and latest applied developments in Artificial  Intelligence. As such AAIA'14 will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between theo- reticians  and practitioners to address the important issues.
