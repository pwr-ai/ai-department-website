An accurate measure of semantic relatedness can be used to extract groups of semantically close words from a corpus. Such groups help a lexicographer make decisions about synset membership and synset placement in the network. We have adapted to Polish the well-known algorithm of Clustering by Committee, and tested it on the largest Polish corpus available.
