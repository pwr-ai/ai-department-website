Most research in the field has concentrated on propagation models and improving seeding strategies as a way to increase coverage. Proponents of such research usually assume selection of seed set and the initialization of the process without any additional support in following stages. The approach presented in this paper shows how initiation by seed set process can be supported by selection and", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "209--218", "booktitle": "International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "jankowski2017increasing"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-61845-6_22", "author_id": ["xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:RipuyeiTZf4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DIncreasing%2Bcoverage%2Bof%2Binformation%2Bspreading%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%2Bwith%2Bsupporting%2Bseeding%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=RipuyeiTZf4J&ei=C9KgYa_vNumGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=18331220486302607942&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:RipuyeiTZf4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Increasing+coverage+of+information+spreading+in+social+networks+with+supporting+seeding&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
