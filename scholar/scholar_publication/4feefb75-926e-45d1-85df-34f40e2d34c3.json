But even the traces of how we communicate can also tell quite a bit about us. In this work, we start from the calling and texting history of 200 students enrolled in the Netsense study, and we link it to the type of relationships that students have with their peers, and even with their personality profiles. First, we show that a Hawkes point process with a power-law decaying kernel can accurately model the calling", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.02032", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "nurek2020hawkes"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02032", "author_id": ["H8fsOdkAAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "J9sjxXYAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:vTf9IPgnET8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHawkes-modeled%2Btelecommunication%2Bpatterns%2Breveal%2Brelationship%2Bdynamics%2Band%2Bpersonality%2Btraits%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=vTf9IPgnET8J&ei=4sqgYeCjMIGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4544457445652379581&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:vTf9IPgnET8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Hawkes-modeled+telecommunication+patterns+reveal+relationship+dynamics+and+personality+traits&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02032"}
