The pattern templates and parameters are specified manually but their instances are both generated and tested on the corpus automatically. The extracted collocations were evaluated by applying them as rules in morphosyntactic disambiguation of", "pages": "237--246", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "broda2007recognition"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/266593107_Recognition_of_structured_collocations_in_an_inflective_language/links/560f800808ae6b29b49a46fc/Recognition-of-structured-collocations-in-an-inflective-language.pdf", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "5RgcfHcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:dDw5nUcA87EJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRecognition%2Bof%2Bstructured%2Bcollocations%2Bin%2Ban%2Binflective%2Blanguage%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=dDw5nUcA87EJ&ei=566gYbe0EIbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 24, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12822592871634386036&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:dDw5nUcA87EJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Recognition+of+structured+collocations+in+an+inflective+language&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/266593107_Recognition_of_structured_collocations_in_an_inflective_language/links/560f800808ae6b29b49a46fc/Recognition-of-structured-collocations-in-an-inflective-language.pdf"}
