 abstract = {It has been shown in this paper that simplistic Bag of Words (BoW) lexicon methods for sentiment polarity assignment with ensemble classifiers are much faster than a supervised approach to sentiment classification while yielding similar accuracy. BoW methods also proved to be efficient and fast across all examined datasets. Moreover, a new approach to lexicon extraction that can be successfully used for sentiment polarity assignment is presented in the paper. It has been shown that accuracy obtained from such lexicons},
