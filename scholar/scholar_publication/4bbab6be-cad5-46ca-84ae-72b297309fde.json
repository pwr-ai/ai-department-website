As social influence can be maximized for many purposes, such as marketing, politics, spreading innovations, there are many stakeholders interested in progress in this area. As it has been shown, for most settings finding an optimal seed set is an NP-hard problem, this is why various heuristics started to emerge since the statement of the problem. In this work, we explore the applicability of evolutionary algorithm", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "77--85", "volume": "31", "journal": "Journal of Computational Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "weskida2019finding"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187775031830070X", "author_id": ["6bvVv74AAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 18, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:8CvnpOykzSsJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DFinding%2Binfluentials%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%2Busing%2Bevolutionary%2Balgorithm%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=8CvnpOykzSsJ&ei=JWNeYZ2-EKPZsQKvo78o", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3156360250142436336&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:8CvnpOykzSsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Finding+influentials+in+social+networks+using+evolutionary+algorithm&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187775031830070X"}
