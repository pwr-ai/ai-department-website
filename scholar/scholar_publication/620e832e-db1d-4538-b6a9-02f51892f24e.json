Their immanent feature is continuous evolution over time. If we know how groups in the social network has evolved we can use this information and try to predict the next step in the given group evolution. In the paper, a new aproach for group evolution prediction is presented and examined. Experimental studies on four evolving social networks revealed that (i) the prediction based on the simple input features", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "54--67", "booktitle": "International Conference on Social Informatics", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "brodka2012predicting"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-35386-4_5", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:8_08pmxASDwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPredicting%2Bgroup%2Bevolution%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bsocial%2Bnetwork%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=8_08pmxASDwJ&ei=j72gYdPuN7GUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 51, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4343792675988504051&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:8_08pmxASDwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Predicting+group+evolution+in+the+social+network&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.5161"}
