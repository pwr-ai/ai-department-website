These embeddings are evaluated in the problem of recognition of temporal expressions (timexes) for the Polish language. We described the process of KGR10 corpus creation and a new approach to the recognition problem using Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with additional CRF layer, where specific embeddings are essential. We presented experiments and conclusions drawn from", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1904.04055", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kocon2019evaluating"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04055", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:XuMzqr6eF0wJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEvaluating%2BKGR10%2BPolish%2Bword%2Bembeddings%2Bin%2Bthe%2Brecognition%2Bof%2Btemporal%2Bexpressions%2Busing%2BBiLSTM-CRF%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=XuMzqr6eF0wJ&ei=56SgYb62MoGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=5483025613083370334&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:XuMzqr6eF0wJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Evaluating+KGR10+Polish+word+embeddings+in+the+recognition+of+temporal+expressions+using+BiLSTM-CRF&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04055"}
