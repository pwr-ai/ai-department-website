Multiple, ensemble learning models have been theoretically and empirically shown to provide significantly better performance than single weak learners, especially while dealing with high dimensional, complex regression and classification problems [Brazdil, 09],[Okun, 08]. Adaptive hybrid systems has become essential in computational intelligence and soft computing, as being able to deal with", "pages": "457--461", "number": "4", "volume": "19", "journal": "J Univers Comput Sci", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kazienko2013hybrid"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://www.jucs.org/jucs_19_4/hybrid_and_ensemble_methods/jucs_19_04_0457_0461_editorial.pdf", "author_id": ["cxLgNccAAAAJ", "G6sMKIkAAAAJ", "f3gKG3kAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Laz1MMB790QJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHybrid%2Band%2Bensemble%2Bmethods%2Bin%2Bmachine%2Blearning%2BJ.%2BUCS%2Bspecial%2Bissue%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=Laz1MMB790QJ&ei=zNKgYaPSI-PUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4969576779211975725&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Laz1MMB790QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Hybrid+and+ensemble+methods+in+machine+learning+J.+UCS+special+issue&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bogdan-Trawinski/publication/220618734_Special_Issue_on_Hybrid_and_Ensemble_Methods_in_Machine_Learning/links/5d513068299bf1995b7813c2/Special-Issue-on-Hybrid-and-Ensemble-Methods-in-Machine-Learning.pdf"}
