Pre-trained models are usually fine tuned to downstream tasks and the obtained vectors are used as an input for deep neural classifiers. No linguistic knowledge obtained from resources and tools is utilised. In this paper we compare such universal approaches with a combination of rich", "pages": "223--233", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 11th Global Wordnet Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "janz2021neural"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.gwc-1.26/", "author_id": ["UNlMg18AAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "PRp78TwAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 0, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:f4yu2Eu6R7MJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DNeural%2BLanguage%2BModels%2Bvs%2BWordnet-based%2BSemantically%2BEnriched%2BRepresentation%2Bin%2BCST%2BRelation%2BRecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=f4yu2Eu6R7MJ&ei=sMFdYZynB6PZsQKvo78o", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:f4yu2Eu6R7MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Neural+Language+Models+vs+Wordnet-based+Semantically+Enriched+Representation+in+CST+Relation+Recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.gwc-1.26.pdf"}
