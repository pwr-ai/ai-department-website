We propose a set of new entropy-based measures for human communication dynamics represented within the temporal social network as event sequences. Using real world datasets and random interaction series of different types we find that real human contact events always significantly differ from random ones. This human distinctiveness increases over time and by means of the proposed entropy measures, we", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group", "pages": "1--8", "number": "1", "volume": "8", "journal": "Scientific reports", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kulisiewicz2018entropy"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32571-3", "author_id": ["", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "2OJOZTUAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:96yZOhEYpWcJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEntropy%2Bmeasures%2Bof%2Bhuman%2Bcommunication%2Bdynamics%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=96yZOhEYpWcJ&ei=9bGgYZ23K8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7468402019340496119&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:96yZOhEYpWcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Entropy+measures+of+human+communication+dynamics&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32571-3"}
