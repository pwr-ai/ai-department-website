They were next applied for evaluation of word embedding models and used to assess and compare the usefulness of different word embeddings extracted from a very large corpus of Polish. We analysed also and compared several publicly available models described in literature. In addition, several large word embeddings models built on the basis of a very large Polish corpus are presented.", "pages": "229--238", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 9th Global Wordnet Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2018wordnet"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2018.gwc-1.26/", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", "UNlMg18AAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 9, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:3O-GFYOMBqkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DWordnet-based%2Bevaluation%2Bof%2Blarge%2Bdistributional%2Bmodels%2Bfor%2Bpolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=3O-GFYOMBqkJ&ei=-bNdYf2yKMKSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12179576736899854300&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:3O-GFYOMBqkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Wordnet-based+evaluation+of+large+distributional+models+for+polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2018.gwc-1.26.pdf"}
