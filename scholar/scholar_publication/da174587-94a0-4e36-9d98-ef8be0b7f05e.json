Additionally, a class homogeneity measure has been introduced. It can be used for pre-assessment of method applicability for particular networks. The presented experimental results on eight datasets revealed that the framework based on random walk concept possesses the promising potential to effectively classify nodes in the network", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "409--424", "number": "4", "volume": "33", "journal": "New Generation Computing", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2015relational"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00354-015-0404-2", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:D85plXOJ574J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRelational%2BClassification%2BUsing%2BRandom%2BWalks%2Bin%2BGraphs%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=D85plXOJ574J&ei=0dWgYZLnGrGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:D85plXOJ574J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Relational+Classification+Using+Random+Walks+in+Graphs&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
