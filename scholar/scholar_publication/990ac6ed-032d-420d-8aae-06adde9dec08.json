Instances of derivative relations described in a wordnet are used in the bootstrapping approach to build an analyser of derivational relations. plWordNet derivational relations are presented and the planned semi-automatic wordnet expansion with derivational relations is discussed. Limits to which form-based markers can encode semantic distinctions are analysed and a model of semantic post-filtering of the generated derivational relation instances is presented.", "pages": "273--280", "booktitle": "Proceedings of 6th International Global Wordnet Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2012automated"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/31907561/gwc2012.pdf#page=278", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "Sv_zNIgAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 10, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:QGN1VPL0BzgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomated%2Bgeneration%2Bof%2Bderivative%2Brelations%2Bin%2Bthe%2BWordnet%2Bexpansion%2Bperspective%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=QGN1VPL0BzgJ&ei=i7JdYfqhD8-TmwHPvZGABQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4037464912597181248&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:QGN1VPL0BzgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automated+generation+of+derivative+relations+in+the+Wordnet+expansion+perspective&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/31907561/gwc2012.pdf#page=278"}
