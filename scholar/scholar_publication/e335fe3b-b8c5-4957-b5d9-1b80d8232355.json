Such network enables to analyse its dynamics. One aspect of the dynamics is analysis of social communities evolution, ie, how particular group changes over time. To do so, the complete group evolution history is needed. That is why in this paper the new method for group evolution extraction called GED is presented.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "316--319", "booktitle": "International Conference on Social Informatics", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "brodka2011tracking"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-24704-0_38", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "DVE_klAAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cCJ5PtDt0s8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTracking%2Bgroup%2Bevolution%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=cCJ5PtDt0s8J&ei=gtSgYdKjHobQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14975293189617427056&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cCJ5PtDt0s8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Tracking+group+evolution+in+social+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.5240"}
