 abstract = {Word Sense Disambiguation in text is still a difficult problem as the best supervised methods require laborious and costly manual preparation of training data. On the other hand, the unsupervised methods express significantly lower accuracy and produce results that are not satisfying for many application. Recently, an algorithm based on weakly-supervised learning for WSD called Lexicographer-Controlled Semi-automatic Sense Disambiguation (LexCSD) was proposed. The method is based on clustering of text snippets},
