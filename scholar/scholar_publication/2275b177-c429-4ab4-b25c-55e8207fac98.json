High linkage quality may be the key to an evolutionary method's effectiveness. Similarly, the faulty linkage may be the reason for its poor performance. Many state-of-the-art evolutionary methods use a Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) to obtain linkage. In this paper, we propose a quality measure for DSM. Based on this measure, we analyze the behavior of modern evolutionary methods. We show the dependency between the linkage and the effectiveness of the", "pages": "742--750", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2020measuring"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3377930.3390242", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:QNa0MaFoZVkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DOn%2Bmeasuring%2Band%2Bimproving%2Bthe%2Bquality%2Bof%2Blinkage%2Blearning%2Bin%2Bmodern%2Bevolutionary%2Balgorithms%2Bapplied%2Bto%2Bsolve%2Bpartially%2Badditively%2Bseparable%2Bproblems%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=QNa0MaFoZVkJ&ei=S9SgYce_NePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6441669883556320832&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:QNa0MaFoZVkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=On+measuring+and+improving+the+quality+of+linkage+learning+in+modern+evolutionary+algorithms+applied+to+solve+partially+additively+separable+problems&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
