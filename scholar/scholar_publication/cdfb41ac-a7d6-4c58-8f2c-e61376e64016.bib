 abstract = {Prediction over edges and nodes in graphs requires appropriate and efficiently achieved data representation. Recent research on representation learning for dynamic networks resulted in a significant progress. However, the more precise and accurate methods, the greater computational and memory complexity. Here, we introduce ICMENâ€“the first-in-class incremental meta-embedding method that produces vector representations of nodes respecting temporal dependencies in the graph. ICMEN efficiently constructs nodes'},
