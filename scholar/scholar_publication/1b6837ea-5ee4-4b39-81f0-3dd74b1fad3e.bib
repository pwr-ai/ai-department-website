 abstract = {Many approaches to the construction of language tools and acquisition of linguistic knowledge from corpora assume the application of some robust shallow parser. Construction of such a parser is difficult in the case of inflective languages with relaxed word order like Polish. The goal of the work presented here is to analyse the extent of knowledge that can be expressed in the form of morphosyntactic constraints referring to morphological properties of word forms, and its applications in the automatic extraction of syntactic and},
