 abstract = {Initialization of information spreading processes within complex networks is usually based on selection of initial nodes as a seed set. While most methods are choosing seeds in a single stage, another possible option is a partial budget usage in the first stage and spending the remaining budget while the process develops. In this paper we analyze how the ratio of seeds used in the primary and supporting stages affects the performance in terms of number of activated nodes and its duration. We have used real networks and agent based},
