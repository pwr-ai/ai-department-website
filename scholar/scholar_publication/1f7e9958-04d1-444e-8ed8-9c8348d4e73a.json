Artificial neural network is used as a classifier. The speech signal is first divided into 20 ms frames. For each frame, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are extracted and the created feature vector is provided into a neural network classifier, which individually classifies each frame as male or female sample. Finally, the whole utterance is classified by selecting the class, for which the sum of", "volume": "22", "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics \\& Technologies", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2013gender"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-b2e43432-277e-4298-8712-26d387089166", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:UZbhYNYphMMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DGender%2Brecognition%2Busing%2Bneural%2Bnetworks%2Band%2BASR%2Btechniques%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=UZbhYNYphMMJ&ei=8bagYdHaL8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14088431535046891089&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:UZbhYNYphMMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Gender+recognition+using+neural+networks+and+ASR+techniques&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-b2e43432-277e-4298-8712-26d387089166/c/2013_v22_Sas.pdf"}
