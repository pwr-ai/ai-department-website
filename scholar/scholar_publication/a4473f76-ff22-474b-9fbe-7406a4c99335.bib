 abstract = {This chapter presents a new evolutionary approach to the Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) as a generalization of some scheduling problems: timetabling, scheduling, multiprocessor scheduling task and other assignment problems. The proposed evolutionary approach to the Graph Coloring Problem utilizes information about the conflict localization in a given coloring. In this context a partial fitness function (pff) and its usage to specialize genetic operators (IBIS and BCX) and phenotypic measure of diversity in population are described},
