It is shown that various modifications can lead to increased convergence, spread or uniformity of achieved Pareto fronts. A clone prevention method is used to increase the spread of resulting sets. Furthermore a crowding operator is removed from the NSGA-II as it serves a similar purpose as the clone prevention, even though it achieves it in a different manner. The former enforces diversity in a", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "412--431", "volume": "481", "journal": "Information Sciences", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "laszczyk2019improved"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025519300039", "author_id": ["", "63xKDRcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:UFIetyILcyYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DImproved%2Bselection%2Bin%2Bevolutionary%2Bmulti%25E2%2580%2593objective%2Boptimization%2Bof%2Bmulti%25E2%2580%2593skill%2Bresource%25E2%2580%2593constrained%2Bproject%2Bscheduling%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=UFIetyILcyYJ&ei=ddSgYdjVI4GUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 27, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2770570439491998288&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:UFIetyILcyYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Improved+selection+in+evolutionary+multi%E2%80%93objective+optimization+of+multi%E2%80%93skill+resource%E2%80%93constrained+project+scheduling+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
