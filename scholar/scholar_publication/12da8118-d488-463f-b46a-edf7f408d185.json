We present a generalised ranking principle and demonstrate its effect on a range of established measures of semantic relatedness, and on a different language. The results confirm that the generalised transformation method based on ranking brings an improvement over several well-known measures.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "187--190", "booktitle": "Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "broda2009rank"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-01818-3_20", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "mFbRWwMAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:EOynj5YfXEMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRank-based%2Btransformation%2Bin%2Bmeasuring%2Bsemantic%2Brelatedness%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=EOynj5YfXEMJ&ei=bKmgYbSMGYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4853789229914254352&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:EOynj5YfXEMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Rank-based+transformation+in+measuring+semantic+relatedness&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "ftp://nozdr.ru/biblio/kolxoz/Cs/CsLn/Advances%20in%20Artificial%20Intelligence,%2022%20conf.,%20Canadian%20AI%202009(LNCS5549,%20Springer,%202009)(ISBN%209783642018176)(308s)_CsLn_.pdf#page=199"}
