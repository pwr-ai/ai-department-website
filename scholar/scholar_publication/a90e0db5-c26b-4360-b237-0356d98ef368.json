The proposed evolutionary approach to the Graph Coloring Problem utilizes information about the conflict localization in a given coloring. In this context a partial fitness function (pff) and its usage to specialize genetic operators (IBIS and BCX) and phenotypic measure of diversity in population are described", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "145--167", "booktitle": "Metaheuristics for Scheduling in Industrial and Manufacturing Applications", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "myszkowski2008solving"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-78985-7_7", "author_id": ["63xKDRcAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 9, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cbcNNKwBzZIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSolving%2Bscheduling%2Bproblems%2Bby%2Bevolutionary%2Balgorithms%2Bfor%2Bgraph%2Bcoloring%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,33&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=cbcNNKwBzZIJ&ei=XF5eYdytAYfBmQGX-6OoBg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10578112938882479985&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cbcNNKwBzZIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Solving+scheduling+problems+by+evolutionary+algorithms+for+graph+coloring+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33"}
