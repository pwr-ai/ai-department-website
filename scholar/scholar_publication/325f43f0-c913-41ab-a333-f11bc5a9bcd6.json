One of its vital problems is collecting numerous annotated emotional samples indispensable for learning the reasoning model. We propose a novel method supporting rich emotional data collection-a pre-trained binary model recognizing physiologically arousing events in real-time and triggering self-assessments at a convenient point in time. An experimental study on 6.000 hours of recorded physiological signals has been performed", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "348--351", "booktitle": "2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications Workshops and other Affiliated Events (PerCom Workshops)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "dziezyc2021catch"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9431143/", "author_id": ["kcZvQwgAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:VfXoeRC4mw8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHow%2Bto%2Bcatch%2Bthem%2Ball%253F%2BEnhanced%2Bdata%2Bcollection%2Bfor%2Bemotion%2Brecognition%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bfield%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=VfXoeRC4mw8J&ei=qbSgYZTrNOmGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1124694912863368533&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:VfXoeRC4mw8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=How+to+catch+them+all%3F+Enhanced+data+collection+for+emotion+recognition+in+the+field&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
