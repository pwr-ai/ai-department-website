 abstract = {The paper presents an attempt at the construction of a wide scale parser for English based on Inductive Learning and limited resources. The parser loosely preserves the shift-reduce scheme, enriched with powerful actions, and a compound Decision Tree instead of the decision table. The attempt originates directly from Hermjakob's ideas [3], but an important goal was to analyse possible extensions to a wide scale solution. Several supporting heuristics, as well as the overview of the development process and experiments, are},
