 abstract = {In this paper a modified selection operator is presented in combination with classical Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). It is shown that various modifications can lead to increased convergence, spread or uniformity of achieved Pareto fronts. A clone prevention method is used to increase the spread of resulting sets. Furthermore a crowding operator is removed from the NSGA-II as it serves a similar purpose as the clone prevention, even though it achieves it in a different manner. The former enforces diversity in a},
