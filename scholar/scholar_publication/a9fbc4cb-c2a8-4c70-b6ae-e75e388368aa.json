Rich inflection in Polish allows us to acquire useful syntactic features without parsing; morphosyntactic restrictions checked in a large enough window provide sufficiently useful data. A novel feature selection method gives the accuracy of 86% on the WordNet-based synonymy test, an improvement of 5% over the previous results.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "99--106", "booktitle": "International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2007automatic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74628-7_15", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", "pulMdOUAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:zD8aAn4yk_MJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomatic%2Bselection%2Bof%2Bheterogeneous%2Bsyntactic%2Bfeatures%2Bin%2Bsemantic%2Bsimilarity%2Bof%2BPolish%2Bnouns%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=zD8aAn4yk_MJ&ei=UM-gYa-SOYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 32, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17551427689575497676&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:zD8aAn4yk_MJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automatic+selection+of+heterogeneous+syntactic+features+in+semantic+similarity+of+Polish+nouns&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
