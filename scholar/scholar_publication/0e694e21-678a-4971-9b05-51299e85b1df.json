Experiments were performed on 12 benchmark data sets and evaluated on 5 established measures of classification quality: micro and macro averaged F1 score, subset accuracy and Hamming loss. Data-driven methods are significantly better than an average run of the random baseline. In case of F1 scores and Subset Accuracy-data driven approaches were more", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "792--801", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "szymanski2017data"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-54472-4_74", "author_id": ["K8v7ROIAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:CYgBfTXwKiQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DIs%2Ba%2BData-Driven%2BApproach%2Bstill%2BBetter%2Bthan%2BRandom%2BChoice%2Bwith%2BNaive%2BBayes%2Bclassifiers%253F%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=CYgBfTXwKiQJ&ei=PL2gYdysFLGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2606159446908438537&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:CYgBfTXwKiQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Is+a+Data-Driven+Approach+still+Better+than+Random+Choice+with+Naive+Bayes+classifiers%3F&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.04013"}
