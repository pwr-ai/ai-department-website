In this paper, we present and validate a procedure of sense-linking between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet. The proposed procedure employs a continuum of three equivalence types: strong, regular and weak, distinguished by a custom-designed set of formal, semantic and translational features. To validate the procedure, three independent", "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "pages": "296--325", "number": "3", "volume": "32", "journal": "International Journal of Lexicography", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "rudnicka2019sense"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ijl/article-abstract/32/3/296/5382106", "author_id": ["rCk4VXEAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "y2WMWysAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:8bUCfKuqsAsJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSense%2Bequivalence%2Bin%2BplWordNet%2Bto%2BPrinceton%2BWordNet%2Bmapping%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=8bUCfKuqsAsJ&ei=56mgYY3ZB-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=842360783814964721&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:8bUCfKuqsAsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Sense+equivalence+in+plWordNet+to+Princeton+WordNet+mapping&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://academic.oup.com/ijl/article-pdf/32/3/296/30011611/ecz004.pdf"}
