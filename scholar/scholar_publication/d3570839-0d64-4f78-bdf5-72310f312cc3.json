Based on lexicographer files and WordNet Domains the mapping goes from synset semantic categories to behavioural and cognitive functions and then directly to brain lobes. A human brain connectome (HBC) adjacency matrix was utilised to capture transition probabilities between brain regions. We evaluated the new structure in several tasks related to semantic similarity and emotion processing using brain-expanded Princeton WordNet", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "102530", "number": "3", "volume": "58", "journal": "Information Processing \\& Management", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kocon2021mapping"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321000388", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:XDtr4B0lDsMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMapping%2BWordNet%2Bonto%2Bhuman%2Bbrain%2Bconnectome%2Bin%2Bemotion%2Bprocessing%2Band%2Bsemantic%2Bsimilarity%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=XDtr4B0lDsMJ&ei=_cigYc-FKcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14055212297319299932&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:XDtr4B0lDsMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Mapping+WordNet+onto+human+brain+connectome+in+emotion+processing+and+semantic+similarity+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306457321000388"}
