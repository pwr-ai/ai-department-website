However, there is still a lack of comprehensive studies of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. We want to fill this gap and propose a comparison with ablation analysis of Aspect Term Extraction using various text embeddings methods. We particularly focused on simple architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with optional conditional random field (CRF) enhancement using different pre-trained word embeddings", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "101217", "journal": "Computer Speech \\& Language", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "augustyniak2021comprehensive"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0885230821000243", "author_id": ["o3apDSYAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:c4SsAUavRQEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DComprehensive%2Banalysis%2Bof%2Baspect%2Bterm%2Bextraction%2Bmethods%2Busing%2Bvarious%2Btext%2Bembeddings%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=c4SsAUavRQEJ&ei=sragYbzrDOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=91672082641618035&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:c4SsAUavRQEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Comprehensive+analysis+of+aspect+term+extraction+methods+using+various+text+embeddings&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04917"}
