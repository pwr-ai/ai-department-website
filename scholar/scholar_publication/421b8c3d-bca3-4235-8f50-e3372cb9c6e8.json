A new plan and schedule need to be determined quickly to increase the responsiveness of the factory and enlarge its profit. Simultaneous optimisation of manufacturing process planning and scheduling leads to better results than a traditional sequential approach but is computationally more expensive and thus difficult to be applied to real-world manufacturing", "pages": "1381--1389", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "zhao2019cloud"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3321707.3321826", "author_id": ["AbH_p9kAAAAJ", "0BoxJ6EAAAAJ", "bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:plcoggIysH4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCloud-based%2Bdynamic%2Bdistributed%2Boptimisation%2Bof%2Bintegrated%2Bprocess%2Bplanning%2Band%2Bscheduling%2Bin%2Bsmart%2Bfactories%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=plcoggIysH4J&ei=WdSgYdrCGeaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=9128851431035000742&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:plcoggIysH4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Cloud-based+dynamic+distributed+optimisation+of+integrated+process+planning+and+scheduling+in+smart+factories&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3321707.3321826"}
