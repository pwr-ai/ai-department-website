The knowledge about the temporal changes of the network topology and characteristics is crucial in networked communication systems in which accurate predictions are important. In this paper a physics-inspired method to track the changes within complex social network is proposed. This method is based on the dynamic molecular modelling technique used in physics for simulation of large sets of interacting particles.
