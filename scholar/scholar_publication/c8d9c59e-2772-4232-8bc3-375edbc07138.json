In this paper, we present a multi population pattern searching algorithm (MuPPetS), which is supposed to be an answer to situations where long coded individuals are a must. MuPPetS uses some of the messy GA ideas like coding and operators. The presented algorithm uses the binary coding, however the objective is to use MuPPetS against real-life", "publisher": "IEEE", "pages": "715--734", "number": "5", "volume": "15", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on evolutionary computation", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kwasnicka2011multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5910464/", "author_id": ["PGRjojAAAAAJ", "bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:GSkihLpZ5F4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti%2Bpopulation%2Bpattern%2Bsearching%2Balgorithm:%2Ba%2Bnew%2Bevolutionary%2Bmethod%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bidea%2Bof%2Bmessy%2Bgenetic%2Balgorithm%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=GSkihLpZ5F4J&ei=PqCgYbXZCoGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 38, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6837688791870875929&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:GSkihLpZ5F4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multi+population+pattern+searching+algorithm:+a+new+evolutionary+method+based+on+the+idea+of+messy+genetic+algorithm&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
