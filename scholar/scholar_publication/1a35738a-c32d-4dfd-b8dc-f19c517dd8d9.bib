 abstract = {Problem decomposition is an important part of many state-of-the-art Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). The quality of the decomposition may be decisive for the EA effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the recent proposition of Linkage Learning based on Local Optimization (3LO). 3LO is an empirical linkage learning (ELL) technique and is proven never to report the false linkage. False linkage is one of the possible linkage defects and occurs when linkage marks two independent genes as a dependent. Although},
