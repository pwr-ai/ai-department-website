The existing interlingual links between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet synsets (sets of synonymous lexical units\u2013lemma and sense pairs) are re-analysed from the perspective of equivalence types as defined in traditional lexicography and translation. Special attention is paid to cognitive and translational equivalents. A proposal of mapping lexical units is presented.
