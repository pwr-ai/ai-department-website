Isolated characters are recognized on the lowest level. The character classification from the lowest level is used in words recognition. Words are recognized using a combined classifier based on possibly incomplete unigram lexicon. Word classifier builds a rank of the most likely words. Ranks created for subsequent words are input to the syntactic classifier, which recognizes the whole sentences.
