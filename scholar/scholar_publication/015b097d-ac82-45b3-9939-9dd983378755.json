    "abstract": "EN In the paper we present a Proper Name Recognition algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Recognition of the Proper Names (PN) is treated as the basis for Named Entity Recognition problem in general. The proposed method is based on combining domain-dependent method based on HMM with domain independent methods based on gazetteers and hand-written rules for recognition and post-processing that capture the general properties of Polish PN structure. A large gazetteer with entries described",
