We propose the WellAff system able to recognize affective states for wellbeing support. It also includes health care scenarios, in particular patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from bipolar disorders. For the need of a large-scale field study, we revised over 50 off-the-shelf devices in terms of usefulness for emotion, stress, meditation, sleep, and physical activity recognition and analysis.
