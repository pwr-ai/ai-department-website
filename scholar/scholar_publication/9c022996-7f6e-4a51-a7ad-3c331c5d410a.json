The aim of the architecture is to provide the decision algorithms and database support for thin client applications running on low cost palmtop computers. We consider the wide class of medical applications, where decision making is equivalent to typical pattern recognition problem. The decision support consists in ordering the decisions by their degree of belief in the context, in which the decision is being", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "105--116", "booktitle": "International Symposium on Biological and Medical Data Analysis", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kurzynski2004decision"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-30547-7_12", "author_id": ["", "T1U6rMcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:wkf-BoEflfoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DDecision%2BSupport%2BServer%2BArchitecture%2Bfor%2BMobile%2BMedical%2BApplications%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=wkf-BoEflfoJ&ei=WpagYfqpBYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=18056372920040441794&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:wkf-BoEflfoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Decision+Support+Server+Architecture+for+Mobile+Medical+Applications&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
