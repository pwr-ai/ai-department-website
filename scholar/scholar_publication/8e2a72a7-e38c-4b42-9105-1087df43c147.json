The goal of this work is to decompose the overall process of tagging of Polish into subproblems of partial disambiguation. Moreover, an architecture of a tagger facilitating this decomposition is proposed. The proposed architecture enables easy integration of hand-written tagging rules with the rest of the tagger. The architecture is open for different types of classifiers.
