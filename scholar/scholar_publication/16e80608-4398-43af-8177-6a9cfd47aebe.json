We present its adaptation to Polish. We consider not only the technicalities such as the availability of language-processing tools for Polish, but also pattern structures which leverage the specificity of a strongly inflected language. We propose a new method of computing the reliability measure of extraction; this leads to a modified algorithm which we have named Estratto. In this paper we investigate the influence of additional lexico-semantic", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "133--141", "booktitle": "International Conference on Text, Speech and Dialogue", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kurc2010automatic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-15760-8_18", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "mFbRWwMAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:fvhLB-HfgkUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomatic%2Bacquisition%2Bof%2Bwordnet%2Brelations%2Bby%2Bdistributionally%2Bsupported%2Bmorphological%2Bpatterns%2Bextracted%2Bfrom%2BPolish%2Bcorpora%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=fvhLB-HfgkUJ&ei=UcKgYYTyK4GEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=5008811893172467838&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:fvhLB-HfgkUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automatic+acquisition+of+wordnet+relations+by+distributionally+supported+morphological+patterns+extracted+from+Polish+corpora&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
