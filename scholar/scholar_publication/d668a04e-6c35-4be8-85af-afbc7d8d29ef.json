    "abstract": "Espresso is a pattern-based algorithm of extracting lexical-semantic relations, defined for English. We present its adaptation to Polish. We consider not only the technicalities such as the availability of language-processing tools for Polish, but also pattern structures which leverage the specificity of a strongly inflected language. We propose a new method of computing the reliability measure of extraction; this leads to a modified algorithm which we have named Estratto. In this paper we investigate the influence of additional lexico-semantic",
