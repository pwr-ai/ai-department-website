The method draws concepts from combinatorial multi\u2013objective optimization, but also adds new mechanisms specific for continuous spaces and multi\u2013modal aspects of the problem. GAP Selection operator is used to keep a high diversity of the population. A clustering mechanism identifies promising areas of the space, that are later optimized with a local search algorithm.
