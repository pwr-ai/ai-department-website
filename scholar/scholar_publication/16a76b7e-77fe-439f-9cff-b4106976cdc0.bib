 abstract = {Node classification in Social Network is currently receiving raising attention in the Social Network Analysis research. The main objective of node classification is to assign the correct label to the unlabeled nodes from a set of all possible class labels. This classification task is performed using features extracted from a Social Network dataset. The success of proper feature extraction significantly influences classification accuracy, providing more discriminative description of the data. This paper describes label-dependent features},
