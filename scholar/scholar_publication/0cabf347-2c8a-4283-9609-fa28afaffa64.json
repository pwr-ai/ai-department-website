Among the most prominent are: the Erd\u0151s\u2013Renyi random graph model, Watts\u2013Strogatz small world model, Albert\u2013Barab\u00e1si preferential attachment model, Price citation model, and many more. Often, researchers working with real-world data are interested in understanding the generative phenomena underlying their empirical graphs. They want to know which of the theoretical graph generation models would most probably generate a particular empirical", "publisher": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute", "pages": "320", "number": "9", "volume": "18", "journal": "Entropy", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2016using"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/154804", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "UwvCguQAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:pHU09KygqHQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DUsing%2BGraph%2Band%2BVertex%2BEntropy%2Bto%2BCompare%2BEmpirical%2BGraphs%2Bwith%2BTheoretical%2BGraph%2BModels%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=pHU09KygqHQJ&ei=Q8-gYdLNIOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=8406145369178928548&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:pHU09KygqHQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Using+Graph+and+Vertex+Entropy+to+Compare+Empirical+Graphs+with+Theoretical+Graph+Models&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/9/320/pdf"}
