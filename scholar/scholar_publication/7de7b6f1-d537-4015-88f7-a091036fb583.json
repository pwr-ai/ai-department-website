The annotation was made by linguists in a 2+ 1 scheme (with inter-annotator agreement analysis). We present a preliminary approach to the classification of labelled data using logistic regression, bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (BiLSTM) and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT).", "pages": "559--567", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2019)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kocon2019multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1066/", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "E81pgs0AAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ja83RPD6JiYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti-level%2Banalysis%2Band%2Brecognition%2Bof%2Bthe%2Btext%2Bsentiment%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bexample%2Bof%2Bconsumer%2Bopinions%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ja83RPD6JiYJ&ei=ZbugYdK2C4iKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2749160532399861645&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:ja83RPD6JiYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multi-level+analysis+and+recognition+of+the+text+sentiment+on+the+example+of+consumer+opinions&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1066.pdf"}
