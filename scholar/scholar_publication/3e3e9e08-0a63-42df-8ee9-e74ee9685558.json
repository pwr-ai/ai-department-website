Character language model describes probability distribution of adjacent character combinations in words. Bidirectional model applies word analysis from left to right and in reversed order, ie it uses conditional probabilities of character succession and character precedence. Character model is used for HMM creation, which is applied as a soft word classifier. Two HMMs are created for left-to-right and right-to", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "679--687", "booktitle": "International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "sas2006application"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11875581_82", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 4, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:f-vbdbAKr60J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bbidirectional%2Bprobabilistic%2Bcharacter%2Blanguage%2Bmodel%2Bin%2Bhandwritten%2Bwords%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=f-vbdbAKr60J&ei=MqtdYbC6AYfBmQGX-6OoBg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12515233642493766527&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:f-vbdbAKr60J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Application+of+bidirectional+probabilistic+character+language+model+in+handwritten+words+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.academia.edu/download/27613245/M_2006_Categorization_of_Intelligent_Data_Engineering.pdf#page=705"}
