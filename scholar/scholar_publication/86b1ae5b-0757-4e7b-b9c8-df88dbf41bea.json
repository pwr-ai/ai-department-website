P3 was shown to be effective for solving various hard theoretical problems. In this paper, we show that for problems built from the bimodal deceptive functions the effectiveness of P3 is low due to low quality of linkage information gathered by P3. Therefore, we propose the feedback operation that periodically copies the current best", "pages": "109--110", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "komarnicki2017parameter"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3067695.3076065", "author_id": ["", "bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:x3Tknu8hX6sJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DParameter-less%2Bpopulation%2Bpyramid%2Bwith%2Bfeedback%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,33&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=x3Tknu8hX6sJ&ei=d6SgYcSCCbGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12348626016319861959&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:x3Tknu8hX6sJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Parameter-less+population+pyramid+with+feedback&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33"}
