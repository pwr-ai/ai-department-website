 abstract = {This paper presents multiple variances of selection operator used in Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II applied to solving Bi-Objective Multi-Skill Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. A hybrid Differential Evolution with Greedy Algorithm has been proven to work very well on the researched problem and so it is used to probe the multi-objective solution space. It is then determined whether a multi-objective approach can outperform single-objective approaches in finding potential Pareto Fronts. Additional modified selection},
