New mechanisms, like linkage learning (LL) that improve the overall method effectiveness, are also proposed. These research directions are promising and lead to effectiveness increase that cannot be questioned. Nevertheless, in this paper, we concentrate on a situation in which the simplification of the method leads to the improvement of its", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "392--402", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2017effectiveness"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-54430-4_38", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", "cnLc7u4AAAAJ", "lAJCBiQAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 5, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:PEHnZYvg6JkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DThe%2Beffectiveness%2Bof%2Bthe%2Bsimplicity%2Bin%2Bevolutionary%2Bcomputation%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=PEHnZYvg6JkJ&ei=W0ReYcOhKYu4mAGqg5LoDg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=11090360971714576700&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:PEHnZYvg6JkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=The+effectiveness+of+the+simplicity+in+evolutionary+computation&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal-Aibin/publication/314071183_The_Effectiveness_of_the_Simplicity_in_Evolutionary_Computation/links/58ee2a3aa6fdcc61cc1239ed/The-Effectiveness-of-the-Simplicity-in-Evolutionary-Computation.pdf"}
