We provide a taxonomy and experimental evaluation of approaches to compare layers in multiplex networks. Our taxonomy includes, systematizes and extends existing approaches, and is complemented by a set of practical guidelines on how to apply them.", "publisher": "The Royal Society Publishing", "pages": "171747", "number": "8", "volume": "5", "journal": "Royal Society open science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "brodka2018quantifying"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsos.171747", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "piYFlU4AAAAJ", "41i7uf4AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:BQL89pjZz2sJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DQuantifying%2Blayer%2Bsimilarity%2Bin%2Bmultiplex%2Bnetworks:%2Ba%2Bsystematic%2Bstudy%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=BQL89pjZz2sJ&ei=gdGgYe3mJumGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7768667133239362053&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:BQL89pjZz2sJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Quantifying+layer+similarity+in+multiplex+networks:+a+systematic+study&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.171747"}
