Analysis of motifs for the large social networks derived from email communication is presented in the paper. The distribution of motifs in all analyzed real social networks is very similar one another and can be treated as the network fingerprint. This property is most distinctive for stronger human relationships.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "97--105", "booktitle": "International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "juszczyszyn2008local"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85565-1_13", "author_id": ["5VX5_gUAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "Dw5QS9wAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 56, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:U8SGjDV6fl8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLocal%2Btopology%2Bof%2Bsocial%2Bnetwork%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bmotif%2Banalysis%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=U8SGjDV6fl8J&ei=nzBeYbOJOo2UmQGz6rqYBQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6881071651078194259&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:U8SGjDV6fl8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Local+topology+of+social+network+based+on+motif+analysis&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Krzysztof-Juszczyszyn-2/publication/225114195_Local_Topology_of_Social_Network_Based_on_Motif_Analysis/links/550170c00cf2d60c0e5ed784/Local-Topology-of-Social-Network-Based-on-Motif-Analysis.pdf"}
