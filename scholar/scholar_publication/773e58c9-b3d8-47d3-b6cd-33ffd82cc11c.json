The knowledge about temporal changes of the network topology and characteristics is crucial in networked communication systems in which accurate predictions are important. The local network topology can be described by the means of network motifs which are small subgraphs--usually containing from 3 to 7 nodes. They were shown to be useful for creating profiles that reveal several properties of the network.
