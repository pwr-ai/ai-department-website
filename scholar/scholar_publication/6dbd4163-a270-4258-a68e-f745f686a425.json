On the other hand, the unsupervised methods yield significantly lower precision and produce results that are not satisfying for many applications. Recently, an algorithm based on weakly-supervised learning for WSD called Lexicographer-Controlled Semi-automatic Sense Disambiguation (LexCSD) was proposed. The method is based on clustering of text snippets", "pages": "419--436", "volume": "40", "journal": "Control and Cybernetics", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "broda2011evaluating"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BATC-0008-0010", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:vXmqUk_v8GMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEvaluating%2Blexicographer%2Bcontrolled%2Bsemi-automatic%2Bword%2Bsense%2Bdisambiguation%2Bmethod%2Bin%2Ba%2Blarge%2Bscale%2Bexperiment%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=vXmqUk_v8GMJ&ei=kbWgYdiHLYiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7201518928133781949&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:vXmqUk_v8GMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Evaluating+lexicographer+controlled+semi-automatic+word+sense+disambiguation+method+in+a+large+scale+experiment&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-BATC-0008-0010/c/httpwww_bg_utp_edu_plartcc2011brodapiasecki.pdf"}
