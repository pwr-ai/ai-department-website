There are many approaches for English, but only a few for inflective languages with almost free word order. In the paper a method for the construction of a similarity function for Polish nouns is proposed. The method uses only simple tools for language processing (eg it does need the application of a parser). The core is the construction of a matrix of co-occurrences of nouns", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "381--390", "booktitle": "International Conference on Business Information Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2007semantic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-72035-5_29", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "pulMdOUAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:mrWbWi1D-2UJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSemantic%2Bsimilarity%2Bmeasure%2Bof%2BPolish%2Bnouns%2Bbased%2Bon%2Blinguistic%2Bfeatures%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=mrWbWi1D-2UJ&ei=wNKgYYXXO8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 30, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7348541079057839514&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:mrWbWi1D-2UJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Semantic+similarity+measure+of+Polish+nouns+based+on+linguistic+features&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
