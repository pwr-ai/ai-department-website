    "abstract": "The paper introduces a novel many-objective evolutionary method, with a diversity-based selection operator and aims to fill the \u201cgaps\u201d in the Pareto Front approximation and to increase its spread. It shows, that guiding the evolution process towards the least explored parts of a space increases overall diversity, but can also lead to increased convergence. A set of experiments is carried out on a many-objective Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem and a bi-objective Travelling Thief Problem. Both of those",
