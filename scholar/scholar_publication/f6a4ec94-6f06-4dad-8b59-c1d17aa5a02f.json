While the network structure serves as the backbone of the spreading, an accurate prediction can hardly be made without the knowledge of the dynamics on the network. The temporal information in the spreading sequence captures many hidden features, but predictions based on sequence alone have their limitations. Recent efforts start to explore the possibility of combining both the network", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.06836", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "wang2021casseqgcn"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06836", "author_id": ["", "", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "", "GUbb0DIAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ezwvZQWSoqIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCasSeqGCN:%2BCombining%2BNetwork%2BStructure%2Band%2BTemporal%2BSequence%2Bto%2BPredict%2BInformation%2BCascades%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ezwvZQWSoqIJ&ei=3p6gYYb6K-PUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 0, "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06836"}
