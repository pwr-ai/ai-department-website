 abstract = {We propose using five data-driven community detection approaches from social networks to partition the label space in the task of multi-label classification as an alternative to random partitioning into equal subsets as performed by RA k EL d. We evaluate modularity-maximizing using fast greedy and leading eigenvector approximations, infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. For this purpose, we propose to construct a label co-occurrence graph (both weighted and unweighted versions) based on training data and},
