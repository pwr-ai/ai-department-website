 abstract = {In the paper we consider the problem of continuous handwriting segmentation into individual characters. The ultimate aim is to create the set of isolated character images used as a training set for the writer-dependent handwriting recognizer. Analytic approach is applied, where word recognition is based on the individual classification of characters. The input to the proposed segmentation method is a handwritten text image consisting of known words. The method consists of three stages. Initially, images of isolated words are over},
