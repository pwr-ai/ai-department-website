The users forming a social network are interpreted as large sets of interacting particles. The data for the conducted research was obtained from e-mail communication within Enron company. The social network of employees was extracted and used to evaluate the methodology of social network dynamics modelling.", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "1--4", "volume": "3", "booktitle": "2010 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "juszczyszyn2010utilizing"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5614791/", "author_id": ["5VX5_gUAAAAJ", "epOcQwMAAAAJ", "Dw5QS9wAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:YMdoLP_dlE8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DUtilizing%2Bdynamic%2Bmolecular%2Bmodelling%2Btechnique%2Bfor%2Bpredicting%2Bchanges%2Bin%2Bcomplex%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=YMdoLP_dlE8J&ei=u6-gYevbFYiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=5734452313580947296&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:YMdoLP_dlE8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Utilizing+dynamic+molecular+modelling+technique+for+predicting+changes+in+complex+social+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.zsi.pwr.wroc.pl/~brodka/art/2010_WI2.pdf"}
