In the paper there are presented four variants of Evolutionary Algorithm applied to MS-RCPSP problem: concerning prioritization the tasks (or resources), combined task-resources prioritizing approach and co-evolution based approach that effectively solves problem dividing it to two subproblems. All approaches are examined using benchmark MS-RCPSP iMOPSE dataset and results show that the problem", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "75--82", "booktitle": "2017 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "myszkowski2017co"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8104515/", "author_id": ["63xKDRcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:yK2sJur9o_sJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCo-evolutionary%2Balgorithm%2Bsolving%2Bmulti-skill%2Bresource-constrained%2Bproject%2Bscheduling%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=yK2sJur9o_sJ&ei=p9agYauXGoiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=18132615706836774344&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:yK2sJur9o_sJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Co-evolutionary+algorithm+solving+multi-skill+resource-constrained+project+scheduling+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2017/drp/pdf/318.pdf"}
