 abstract = {The following chapter aims to present the current research in the area of modelling and maximizing social influence in networks. Apart from describing the most popular models for this process, it focuses on presenting the advances in maximizing the spread of influence in social networks. Since most of the research was suited for static networks case, nowadays it is necessary to move it toward the networks that are everywhere around us—the dynamic ones. As is widely agreed in the scientific community, static networks are unacceptable},
