To satisfy these needs, new network technologies like Elastic Optical Networks (EON) are proposed. The EONs bring new, hard optimization problems, like Routing and Spectrum Allocation problem considered in this paper. The well-known and common tools to solve the NP-hard problems are Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). A number of EA-based methods were proposed to solve the RSA problem", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "328--339", "booktitle": "International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2015multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24834-9_39", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:HZ5978wKnYoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti%2Bpopulation%2Bpattern%2Bsearching%2Balgorithm%2Bfor%2Bsolving%2Brouting%2Bspectrum%2Ballocation%2Bwith%2Bjoint%2Bunicast%2Band%2Banycast%2Bproblem%2Bin%2Belastic%2Boptical%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=HZ5978wKnYoJ&ei=WbqgYZKqB-PUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=9988151423885221405&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:HZ5978wKnYoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multi+population+pattern+searching+algorithm+for+solving+routing+spectrum+allocation+with+joint+unicast+and+anycast+problem+in+elastic+optical+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michal-Przewozniczek/publication/287215339_Multi_Population_Pattern_Searching_Algorithm_for_Solving_Routing_Spectrum_Allocation_with_Joint_Unicast_and_Anycast_Problem_in_Elastic_Optical_Networks/links/5674286908ae0ad265ba7300/Multi-Population-Pattern-Searching-Algorithm-for-Solving-Routing-Spectrum-Allocation-with-Joint-Unicast-and-Anycast-Problem-in-Elastic-Optical-Networks.pdf"}
