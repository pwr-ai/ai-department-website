Its crucial tool are sentiment polarities assigned to synsets (synonym sets) corresponding to abstract meanings existing the natural language. Synsets, together with their lexico-semantic relations are the essential components of every WordNet. The main idea of a new approach to sentiment assignment in WordNet based on relational propagation is presented in the paper.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "137--140", "booktitle": "International Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization and Engineering", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "misiaszek2013relational"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40840-3_20", "author_id": ["", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 1, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:4Rb-uJXWk-QJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRelational%2BPropagation%2Bof%2BWord%2BSentiment%2Bin%2BWordNet%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=4Rb-uJXWk-QJ&ei=S5ZdYYflCc-TmwHPvZGABQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16470744200766166753&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:4Rb-uJXWk-QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Relational+Propagation+of+Word+Sentiment+in+WordNet&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Do-Young-Kim-4/publication/292878692_Interactive_Decision_Making_Environment_for_the_Design_Optimization_of_Climate_Adaptive_Building_Shells/links/58f5a017458515ff23b587ff/Interactive-Decision-Making-Environment-for-the-Design-Optimization-of-Climate-Adaptive-Building-Shells.pdf#page=147"}
