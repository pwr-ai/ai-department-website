It may happen that none of the labels of the nodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is:\" labels of which nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to", "number": "1", "volume": "29", "journal": "AI Communications: the European journal on artificial intelligence", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "musial2016learning"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/23014/", "author_id": ["Dw5QS9wAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:wlxfdopsabQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLearning%2Bin%2BUnlabelled%2BNetworks%25E2%2580%2593An%2BActive%2BLearning%2Band%2BInference%2BApproach%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=wlxfdopsabQJ&ei=upegYbnjIoGUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:wlxfdopsabQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Learning+in+Unlabelled+Networks%E2%80%93An+Active+Learning+and+Inference+Approach&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/23014/1/[kamu16]%20-%20active_learning.pdf"}
