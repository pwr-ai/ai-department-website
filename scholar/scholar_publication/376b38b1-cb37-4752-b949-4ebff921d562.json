The model has originated from the previous one (the versions 2.0 and 3.0) as a combination of simplifications and expansions. The simplifications were motivated by the collected experience of the previous model implementation for almost 18 thousand Polish verbs. The proposed expansions are meant to improve the description of verbs and support provided by plWordNet for various applications.", "pages": "174--187", "booktitle": "LDK Workshops", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "dziob2017towards"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1899/CfWNs_2017_proc6-paper_7.pdf", "author_id": ["y9GCRMsAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:v4lIOnDJzRwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTowards%2BRevised%2BSystem%2Bof%2BVerb%2BWordnet%2BRelations%2Bfor%2BPolish.%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=v4lIOnDJzRwJ&ei=z8qgYffCH7GUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2075536487139019199&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:v4lIOnDJzRwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Towards+Revised+System+of+Verb+Wordnet+Relations+for+Polish.&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1899/CfWNs_2017_proc6-paper_7.pdf"}
