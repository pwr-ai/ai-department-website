The described optimization issue is part of a wider domain of Computer-Aided Architectural Design. The article covers the extensive description of the representation domain model (architectural canonical guidelines, user design requirements and constraints) and the explanation of proposed approach: problem representation, genetic algorithm operators, and fitness function definition.
