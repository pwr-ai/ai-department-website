 abstract = {A key challenge of the Information Extraction in Natural Language Processing is the ability to recognise and classify temporal expressions (timexes). It is a crucial source of information about when something happens, how often something occurs or how long something lasts. Timexes extracted automatically from text, play a major role in many Information Extraction systems, such as question answering or event recognition. We prepared a broad specification of Polish timexesâ€“PLIMEX. It is based on the state-of-the-art annotation},
