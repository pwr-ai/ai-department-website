 abstract = {In this paper novel project scheduling difficulty estimations are proposed for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP). The main goal of introducing the complexity estimations is an attempt of estimation the project complexity before launching the optimization process. What is more, the dataset instance generator is also presented as a tool to create new instances for extending the research area. Furthermore, the dataset proposed in previous works is extended by new instances},
