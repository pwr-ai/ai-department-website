 abstract = {We present a direct method of construction of a morphosyntactic guesser for Polish, which is a program producing morphosyntactic descriptions for word forms unknown to the morphological analyser. The core of the method is the construction of a statistical a tergo index, in which pseudo-suffixes (endings) extracted by a statistical tree define morpho-syntactic properties of corresponding word forms. The secondary aim was to investigate to what extent it is possible to develop the morphological analyses exclusively on the basis of},
