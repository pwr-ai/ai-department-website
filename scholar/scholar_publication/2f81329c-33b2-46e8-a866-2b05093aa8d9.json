    "abstract": "This document presents a method of a logical links structure recognition between elements on diagrams. The applied approach intuitively mimics a human way of recognition that relies on merging already found connectors into more complex ones. This procedure is modeled by our method where simple and obvious connectors and gradually extended to more complex structures. Each iteration may lead to modification of connectors set obtained so far. The modifications are managed by a rules set describing logical and graphical constraints",
