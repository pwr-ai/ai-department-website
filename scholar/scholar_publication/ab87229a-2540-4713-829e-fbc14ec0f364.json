    "abstract": "The new promising technologies in the network communication field bring the possibilities of faster and more safe information sending. However, the new technologies bring up new computation problems as well. The network flow may be organized in a better way with respect to different criteria. It is common that such problems are hard not only because of their size, but also due to their NP-complete or NP-hard nature. The Genetic Algorithms are commonly known and widely used tools, which allow to effectively solve such problems. It is",
