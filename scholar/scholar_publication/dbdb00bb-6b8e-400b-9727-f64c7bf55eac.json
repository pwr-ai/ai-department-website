We focused our attention on the chosen case of text extraction problem from specific type of images where text is imposed over graphical layer of vector images (charts, diagrams, etc.). For such images we proposed three-stage method using OCR tools as some kind of feed-back in process of text region searching. Some experimental results and examples of practical applications of recognition method are also briefly described.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "527--538", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computer Recognition Systems CORES 2013", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "sas2013three"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00969-8_52", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:OWTuX3wyf-cJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DThree-stage%2Bmethod%2Bof%2Btext%2Bregion%2Bextraction%2Bfrom%2Bdiagram%2Braster%2Bimages%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=OWTuX3wyf-cJ&ei=WZmgYbnnFePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 15, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16681107054570398777&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:OWTuX3wyf-cJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Three-stage+method+of+text+region+extraction+from+diagram+raster+images&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
