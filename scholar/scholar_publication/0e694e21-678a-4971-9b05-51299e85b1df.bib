 abstract = {We study the performance of data-driven, a priori and random approaches to label space partitioning for multi-label classification with a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier. Experiments were performed on 12 benchmark data sets and evaluated on 5 established measures of classification quality: micro and macro averaged F1 score, subset accuracy and Hamming loss. Data-driven methods are significantly better than an average run of the random baseline. In case of F1 scores and Subset Accuracy-data driven approaches were more},
