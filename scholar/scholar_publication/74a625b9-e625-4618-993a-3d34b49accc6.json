The architecture is applied in the construction of Logo-a dialogue system for Polish, based on the Discourse Representation theory, implementing some aspects of the pragmatic analysis and enabling communication with an agent acting in the virtual reality of a blocks world. Logo deals also with the selected issues of coreference resolution. The proposed architecture is intended to be flexible and open for utilisation of diverged language resources.", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "178--183", "booktitle": "5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2005logo"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1578781/", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:pY4H1_djs84J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLogo-the%2Bmodular%2Bconversational%2Bagent%2Bunderstanding%2BPolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=pY4H1_djs84J&ei=ENKgYb3CKMySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:pY4H1_djs84J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Logo-the+modular+conversational+agent+understanding+Polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
