 abstract = {We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) usage to image clustering applied to Document Search Engine (DSE). Each document is described by its visual content (including images), preprocessed and clustered by EA. Next, such clusters are core of DSE. However, number of documents and attached images make EA ineffective in such task. Using the natural issue of EA we propose GPGPU (General Purpose Graphic Processing Unit) implementation. The paper describes our proposition, research and results gained in experiments.},
