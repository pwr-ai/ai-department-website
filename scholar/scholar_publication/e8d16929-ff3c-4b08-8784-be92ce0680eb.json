We have taken into account the limited set of language tools for Polish, and especially that syntactic and semantic parsers do not express accuracy and robustness high enough and to become a stable basis for similarity computation. A very large wordnet of Polish, namely plWordNet is used to construct meaning representations for words in such a way that different words of the similar meaning receive similar representations.
