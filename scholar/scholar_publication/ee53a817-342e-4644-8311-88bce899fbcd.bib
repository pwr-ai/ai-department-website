 abstract = {The novel approach to speaker adaptation within speech recognition system basing on late clustering of prototype speakers is presented. For a new speaker the speaker prototype is created dynamically on the basis of selected remembered prototypes that are similar enough to the new one. The training utterances are prepared in an optimized way to decrease training duration without negative influence on recognition accuracy.},
