The recognition process is decomposed into three levels: character recognition, word recognition and form contents recognition. On the word and form contents level the probabilistic lexicons are available. The decision on the word level is performed using results of character classification based on a character image analysis and probabilistic lexicon treated as a", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "1--12", "booktitle": "International Symposium on Biological and Medical Data Analysis", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "sas2005application"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11573067_1", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:SVtetWQEhsoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DApplication%2Bof%2Bthree-level%2Bhandprinted%2Bdocuments%2Brecognition%2Bin%2Bmedical%2Binformation%2Bsystems%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=SVtetWQEhsoJ&ei=5NKgYZaTHYiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14593356473126771529&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:SVtetWQEhsoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Application+of+three-level+handprinted+documents+recognition+in+medical+information+systems&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
