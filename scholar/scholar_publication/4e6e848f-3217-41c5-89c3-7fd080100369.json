One of them is node position, useful to assess the importance of a given node within both the whole network and its smaller subgroups. However, to analyze large social networks a lot of effort and resources are necessary. In this paper, some algorithms that can be utilized in the process of node position evaluation are presented and their efficiency is tested. In particular, three distinct algorithms were developed and", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "455--463", "booktitle": "International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "brodka2009efficiency"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04592-9_57", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "Dw5QS9wAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:HWetRnHfdBsJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEfficiency%2Bof%2Bnode%2Bposition%2Bcalculation%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=HWetRnHfdBsJ&ei=t52gYe-HKYiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1978451813932558109&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:HWetRnHfdBsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Efficiency+of+node+position+calculation+in+social+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.kkio.pwr.wroc.pl/~brodka/art/2009_KES.pdf"}
