    "abstract": "Many collections of numbers do not have a uniform distribution of the leading digit, but conform to a very particular pattern known as Benford's distribution. This distribution has been found in numerous areas such as accounting data, voting registers, census data, and even in natural phenomena. Recently it has been reported that Benford's law applies to online social networks. Here we introduce a set of rigorous tests for adherence to Benford's law and apply it to verification of this claim, extending the scope of the experiment to various",
