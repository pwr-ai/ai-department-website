 abstract = {This paper presents approaches to hierarchical clustering of images using a GHSOM in application as image search engine. It is analysed some hierarchical clustering and SOMs variants. Experiments are based on benchmark ICPR and MIRFlickr image datasets. As quality of gained solution the external and the internal measures are analysed.},
