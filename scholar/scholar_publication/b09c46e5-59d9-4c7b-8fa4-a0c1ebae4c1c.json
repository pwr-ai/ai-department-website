We present a method of automated transforming synset mapping to sense mapping to build a network of translational equivalents. Two heuristics based on a cross-lingual distributional similarity model are compared with several variants of machine learning based approach exploring different descriptive features. The features are extracted from bilingual and monolingual dictionaries and distributional semantics models, interpreted against", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "668--681", "booktitle": "International Conference on Computational Collective Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2020automated"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-63007-2_52", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", "rCk4VXEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ypc7q_GiyCEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomated%2BBilingual%2BLinking%2Bof%2BWordnet%2BSenses%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ypc7q_GiyCEJ&ei=MNSgYdCpFcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:ypc7q_GiyCEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automated+Bilingual+Linking+of+Wordnet+Senses&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
