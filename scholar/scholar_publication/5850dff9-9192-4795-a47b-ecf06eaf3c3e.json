In this paper, two parallel approaches to process large graph structures within the Hadoop environment were compared: Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and MapReduce (MR). The experimental studies were carried out for two different graph problems: collective classification by means of Relational Influence Propagation (RIP) and Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) calculation.
