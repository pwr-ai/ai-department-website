The first model focuses on the creation of a language-agnostic representation of each sentence. The second one aims to predict the sentiment of the text based on these sentence representations. Besides models evaluation on PolEmo 1.0 Sentiment Corpus, we also conduct a proof of concept for", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "128--137", "volume": "176", "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kanclerz2020cross"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092031838X", "author_id": ["eLnKhqkAAAAJ", "", "pmQHb5IAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 8, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:nbAKW-vv7ywJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCross-lingual%2Bdeep%2Bneural%2Btransfer%2Blearning%2Bin%2Bsentiment%2Banalysis%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=nbAKW-vv7ywJ&ei=uZ5dYZPaF6PZsQKvo78o", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3238070451226456221&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:nbAKW-vv7ywJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Cross-lingual+deep+neural+transfer+learning+in+sentiment+analysis&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705092031838X/pdf?md5=fa7399c703d0ac6ebaa5a03f4f0461df&pid=1-s2.0-S187705092031838X-main.pdf"}
