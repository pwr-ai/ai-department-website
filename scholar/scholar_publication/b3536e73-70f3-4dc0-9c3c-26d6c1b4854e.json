Three collective classification algorithms were described and examined in the paper: Iterative Classification (ICA), Gibbs Sampling (GS) and Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP). Experiments on various networks revealed that greater number of output classes decreases classification accuracy, GS provides better results than ICA and LBP outperforms", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "99--108", "booktitle": "New Trends in Databases and Information Systems", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2013collective"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32518-2_10", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 9, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:fL-UYK-ctSYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCollective%2Bclassification%2Btechniques:%2Ban%2Bexperimental%2Bstudy%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,44&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=fL-UYK-ctSYJ&ei=0pRdYeHhAc6_mQHMm7boDg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2789307821279461244&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:fL-UYK-ctSYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Collective+classification+techniques:+an+experimental+study&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "eprint_url": "https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~kazienko/pub/2012/ADBISmcsd2012.pdf"}
