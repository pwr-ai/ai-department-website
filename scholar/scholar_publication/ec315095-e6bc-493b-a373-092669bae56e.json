The analysis of three-nodes motifs where the colour of the node reflects its high\u2013white node or low\u2013black node centrality in the social network is presented in the paper. The importance of the vertices is assessed by utilizing two measures: degree prestige and degree centrality. The distribution of motifs in these two cases is compared to mine the interconnection patterns between nodes.
