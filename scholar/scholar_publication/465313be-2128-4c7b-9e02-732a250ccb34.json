Profile cloning detection creates a possibility to detect frauds that would use people's trust to gather social information. This paper proposes two novel methods of profile cloning detection and also presents state-of-the-art research. The first method is based on the similarity of attributes from both profiles and the second method is based on the similarity of relationship networks. The methods are further evaluated with", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "63--68", "booktitle": "2014 European Network Intelligence Conference", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "brodka2014profile"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6984892/", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cM_SAjabKXMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DProfile%2Bcloning%2Bdetection%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=cM_SAjabKXMJ&ei=rrKgYb7mCYbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 9, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=8298334444684758896&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cM_SAjabKXMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Profile+cloning+detection+in+social+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Piotr-Brodka/publication/287082181_Profile_Cloning_Detection_in_Social_Networks/links/57def06808ae5292a37f400e/Profile-Cloning-Detection-in-Social-Networks.pdf"}
