This knowledge can then be leveraged in an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) to improve the optimization process. Of particular interest is the Gene-pool Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) family, which has been shown to exploit linkage effectively. Recently, Empirical Linkage Learning (ELL) techniques were proposed for binary-encoded problems. While these techniques are computationally expensive, they have the benefit of", "pages": "1442--1450", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2021hybrid"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3449726.3463152", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 0, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:6T3jcuU4jEYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHybrid%2Blinkage%2Blearning%2Bfor%2Bpermutation%2Boptimization%2Bwith%2BGene-pool%2Boptimal%2Bmixing%2Bevolutionary%2Balgorithms%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=6T3jcuU4jEYJ&ei=HUdeYcndKIfBmQGX-6OoBg", "eprint_url": "https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/31039/31039.pdf"}
