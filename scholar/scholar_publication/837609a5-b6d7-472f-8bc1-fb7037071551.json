Because it is NP-hard, some heuristics were proposed to find sub-optimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used assumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the dynamic one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks, where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of time. The main purpose of this paper is to analyse how the results of one of the", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "213--235", "number": "3-4", "volume": "32", "journal": "New Generation Computing", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "michalski2014seed"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00354-014-0402-9.pdf", "author_id": ["xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:PiAyYGSNGtQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSeed%2Bselection%2Bfor%2Bspread%2Bof%2Binfluence%2Bin%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks:%2BTemporal%2Bvs.%2Bstatic%2Bapproach%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=PiAyYGSNGtQJ&ei=fpqgYYO0IeaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 43, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=15283683747685343294&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:PiAyYGSNGtQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Seed+selection+for+spread+of+influence+in+social+networks:+Temporal+vs.+static+approach&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0538"}
