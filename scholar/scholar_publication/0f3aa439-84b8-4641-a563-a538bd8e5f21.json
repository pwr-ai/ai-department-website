The general open architecture of the tagger is presented, where the overall process of tagging is divided into subsequent steps and the overall problem is reduced to subproblems of ambiguity classes. A special language of constraints and the use of constraints as elements of decision trees are described. The results of the experiments performed with the tagger are", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "531--540", "booktitle": "Intelligent Information Processing and Web Mining", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "piasecki2006reductionistic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-33521-8_57", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 15, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:XEZfKvrfveoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DReductionistic,%2Btree%2Band%2Brule%2Bbased%2Btagger%2Bfor%2BPolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=XEZfKvrfveoJ&ei=H7FdYafyI6PZsQKvo78o", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16914922041019156060&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:XEZfKvrfveoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Reductionistic,+tree+and+rule+based+tagger+for+Polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.140.9030&rep=rep1&type=pdf"}
