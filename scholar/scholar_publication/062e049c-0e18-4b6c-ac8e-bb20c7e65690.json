Therefore, we propose a new, adaptable, generic, and multistage method for Group Evolution Prediction (GEP) in complex networks, that facilitates reasoning about the future states of the recently discovered groups. The precise GEP modularity enabled us to carry out extensive and versatile empirical studies on many real", "publisher": "Public Library of Science San Francisco, CA USA", "pages": "e0224194", "number": "10", "volume": "14", "journal": "PloS one", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "saganowski2019analysis"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224194", "author_id": ["DVE_klAAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ", "hEVRtosAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:QdxXngClC8oJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Bgroup%2Bevolution%2Bprediction%2Bin%2Bcomplex%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,10&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=QdxXngClC8oJ&ei=SqKgYZujGOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 11, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14558911642480401473&as_sdt=40005&sciodt=0,10&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:QdxXngClC8oJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Analysis+of+group+evolution+prediction+in+complex+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,10", "eprint_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0224194"}
