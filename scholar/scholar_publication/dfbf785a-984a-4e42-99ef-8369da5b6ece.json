They represent wide variety of semantic oppositions. Analysis of morphological word forms in terms of prefixes and suffixes provides limited information about their semantics. We propose a method of semantic classification of the potential derivational pairs. The method is based on supervised learning, but requires only a list of word pairs assigned to the derivational relations.
