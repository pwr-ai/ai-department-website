In the proposed method we tried to take into account the features and specific problems experienced in practical applications of speech recognition in the Polish language, reach inflection, a loose word order and the tendency for short word deletion. The LM is created in five stages. Each successive stage takes the model prepared at the", "number": "3", "volume": "23", "journal": "International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2013pipelined"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-9e24b35a-3723-46a1-b725-dd7b9e63f0ac", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:DFefKay-jwMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPipelined%2Blanguage%2Bmodel%2Bconstruction%2Bfor%2BPolish%2Bspeech%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=DFefKay-jwMJ&ei=dpmgYdvuB-mGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=256633350425368332&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:DFefKay-jwMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Pipelined+language+model+construction+for+Polish+speech+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-9e24b35a-3723-46a1-b725-dd7b9e63f0ac/c/Sas.pdf"}
