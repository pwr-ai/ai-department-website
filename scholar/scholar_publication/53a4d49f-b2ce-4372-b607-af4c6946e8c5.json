In this paper we present an application of evolutionary algorithm, a rules induction algorithm in evolution process, called IBIS (Iteration Build Solution). IBIS uses the matrix representation of the timetable and the partial fitness function. It allows not only to evaluate an individual, but it also allows to evaluate each individual's part in co-operating with others.
