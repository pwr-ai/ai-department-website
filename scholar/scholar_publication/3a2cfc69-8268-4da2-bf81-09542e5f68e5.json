    "abstract": "The timetable problem is known as multi-dimensional NP-complete, involving combinatorial optimization and it is a representative of the multi-constrained class. In this paper we present an application of evolutionary algorithm, a rules induction algorithm in evolution process, called IBIS (Iteration Build Solution). IBIS uses the matrix representation of the timetable and the partial fitness function. It allows not only to evaluate an individual, but it also allows to evaluate each individual's part in co-operating with others. A fuzzy logic paradigm is used for",
