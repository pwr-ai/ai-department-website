In contrast to the traditional distributed GA following the island model, the proposed islands are executed asynchronously and exchange solutions at time points depending solely on the optimisation progress at each island. Several solutions' exchange strategies are proposed, implemented in Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "247--259", "booktitle": "International Conference on the Economics of Grids, Clouds, Systems, and Services", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "zhao2019cloud"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-36027-6_21", "author_id": ["AbH_p9kAAAAJ", "", "0BoxJ6EAAAAJ", "bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:q27bEFW0ryoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCloud-based%2Bintegrated%2Bprocess%2Bplanning%2Band%2Bscheduling%2Boptimisation%2Bvia%2Basynchronous%2Bislands%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=q27bEFW0ryoJ&ei=4NSgYefrBYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3075875347965374123&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:q27bEFW0ryoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Cloud-based+integrated+process+planning+and+scheduling+optimisation+via+asynchronous+islands&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/148283/1/GECON_2019.pdf"}
