The introduced changes are of more technical character like the adaptation to the existing Polish language tools, but also we investigate the structure of the patterns that takes into account specific features of Polish as an inflectional language. A new method of the reliability measure computation is proposed. The modified version of the algorithm called Estratto was compared with the more direct", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "181--188", "booktitle": "2008 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kurc2008automatic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4747237/", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:qUsyGusWd7QJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomatic%2Bacquisition%2Bof%2Bwordnet%2Brelations%2Bby%2Bthe%2Bmorpho-syntactic%2Bpatterns%2Bextracted%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2Bcorpora%2Bin%2BPolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=qUsyGusWd7QJ&ei=fqOgYd3WH8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=13003887648068225961&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:qUsyGusWd7QJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automatic+acquisition+of+wordnet+relations+by+the+morpho-syntactic+patterns+extracted+from+the+corpora+in+Polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/224370544_Automatic_acquisition_of_wordnet_relations_by_the_morpho-syntactic_patterns_extracted_from_the_corpora_in_Polish/links/0046352a96bad96bcd000000/Automatic-acquisition-of-wordnet-relations-by-the-morpho-syntactic-patterns-extracted-from-the-corpora-in-Polish.pdf"}
