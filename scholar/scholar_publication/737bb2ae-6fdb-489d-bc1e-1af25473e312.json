During the past few years, researchers have proposed many relational classification methods. However, almost none of them was able to work efficiently with large amounts of data or sparsely labelled networks. It is introduced in this paper a new approach to relational classification based on competence region", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "236--244", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2013competence"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-36543-0_25", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:CtyK6b9gQYYJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCompetence%2Bregion%2Bmodelling%2Bin%2Brelational%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=CtyK6b9gQYYJ&ei=f6mgYdfgKIbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=9674119851941747722&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:CtyK6b9gQYYJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Competence+region+modelling+in+relational+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
