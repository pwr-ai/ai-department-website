The existing approaches to guessing unknown word lemmas and descriptions do not provide results on a satisfactory level. Moreover, lemmatisation of multi-word named entities cannot be solved by word-by-word lemmatisation in Polish. Multi-word named entity lemmas (eg included in gazetteers) often contain word forms that differ from lemmas of their", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "34--44", "booktitle": "International Conference on Natural Language Processing", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kocon2014named"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10888-9_4", "author_id": ["pmQHb5IAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:jrMrqfk9vssJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DNamed%2BEntity%2BMatching%2BMethod%2BBased%2Bon%2Bthe%2BContext-Free%2BMorphological%2BGenerator%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=jrMrqfk9vssJ&ei=bo-gYe-OCePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14681239977768760206&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:jrMrqfk9vssJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Named+Entity+Matching+Method+Based+on+the+Context-Free+Morphological+Generator&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jan-Kocon-2/publication/290551946_Named_Entity_Matching_Method_Based_on_the_Context-Free_Morphological_Generator/links/5982f081a6fdcc8bd247c019/Named-Entity-Matching-Method-Based-on-the-Context-Free-Morphological-Generator.pdf"}
