 abstract = {A new method of feature extraction in the social network for within-network classification is proposed in the paper. The method provides new features calculated by combination of both: network structure information and class labels assigned to nodes. The influence of various features on classification performance has also been studied. The experiments on real-world data have shown that features created owing to the proposed method can lead to significant improvement of classification accuracy.},
