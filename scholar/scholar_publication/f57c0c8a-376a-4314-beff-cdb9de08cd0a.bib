 abstract = {Laborious construction of large wordnets (lexico-semantic networks) can be supported by automatic wordnet expansion methods. Several methods were proposed but mostly were not thoroughly evaluated and compared. In the paper an evaluation methodology for automated wordnet expansion algorithms is proposed. Basic requirements for it are formulated in relation to the linguistic process. The general scheme based on the idea of automated wordnet reconstruction is presented. The methodology is illustrated by applying it},
