An interesting scientific problem in this domain is the assessment of the node position within the directed, weighted graph that represents the social network of email users. The new method of node position analysis, which takes into account both the node positions of the neighbors and the strength of connections between network nodes, is presented in the paper. The node position can be", "publisher": "Citeseer", "number": "1", "volume": "38", "journal": "Control \\& Cybernetics", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kazienko2009evaluation"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.410.4577&rep=rep1&type=pdf", "author_id": ["cxLgNccAAAAJ", "Dw5QS9wAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:0XzunsDhA-cJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Bnode%2Bposition%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bemail%2Bcommunication.%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=0XzunsDhA-cJ&ei=6MqgYffBBIbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 53, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16646396865107885265&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:0XzunsDhA-cJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Evaluation+of+node+position+based+on+email+communication.&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.410.4577&rep=rep1&type=pdf"}
