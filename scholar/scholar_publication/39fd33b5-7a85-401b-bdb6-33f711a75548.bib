 abstract = {Since the amount of information is rapidly growing, there is an overwhelming interest in efficient network computing. In this article, we take a detailed look at the problem of modelling and optimization of aforementioned systems for k-nearest neighbour classifier. First, we present a comprehensive discussion on considered classification methods with a special focus on improving classification accuracy or response time through the use of partitions of original data set for the nearest neighbour rule. Next, we propose a generic},
