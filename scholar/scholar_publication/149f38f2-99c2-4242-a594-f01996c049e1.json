In our solution we use two-step compression of tweets using Byte Pair Encoding algorithm and vectorisation as an input to the distributional model generated for the large corpus of Polish tweets by word2vec algorithm. Our method achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art approaches for the similar task on English tweets and expresses a very good performance in the classification", "pages": "409--417", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2019)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "grzybowski2019sparse"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1048/", "author_id": ["", "", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:hG_klnGM_kEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSparse%2Bcoding%2Bin%2Bauthorship%2Battribution%2Bfor%2BPolish%2Btweets%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=hG_klnGM_kEJ&ei=7rWgYcbKHIbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4755392676040568708&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:hG_klnGM_kEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Sparse+coding+in+authorship+attribution+for+Polish+tweets&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1048.pdf"}
