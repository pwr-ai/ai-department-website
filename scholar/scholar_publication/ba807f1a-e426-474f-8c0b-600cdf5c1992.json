Aggregated prediction of sequential repayment values over time for a set of claims is performed by means of hybrid combination of various machine learning techniques, including clustering of references, model selection and enrichment of input variables with prediction outputs from preceding periods. Experimental studies on real data revealed usefulness of the proposed approach for claim appraisals.
