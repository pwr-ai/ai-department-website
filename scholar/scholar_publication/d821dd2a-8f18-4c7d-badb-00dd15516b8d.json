Among the most prominent are: Erdos-Renyi random graph model, Watts-Strogatz small world model, Albert-Barab\u00e1si preferential attachment model, Price citation model, and many more. Often, researchers working on an empirical graph want to know, which of the theoretical graph generation models is the closest, ie, which theoretical model would generate a graph the most similar to the given empirical graph.
