For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage, limiting the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential of social influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade ago, researchers started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The challenge is to find the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to maximise the influence spread in networks.
