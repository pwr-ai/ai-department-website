 abstract = {The WordNet Weaver application supports extension of a new wordnet. One of its functions is to suggest lexical units semantically close to a given unit. Suggestions arise from activation-area attachment–multi-criteria voting based on several algorithms that score semantic relatedness. We present the contributing algorithms and the method of combining them. Starting from a manually constructed core wordnet and a list of over 1000 units to add, we observed a linguist at work.},
