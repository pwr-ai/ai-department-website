Three-level form analysis architecture is proposed. The lower alphabetical level is responsible for separate character recognition. On the intermediate level, recognised strings are verified against the lexicons of items specific for a particular form field. Probabilistic model is used to select the set of most probable items. On the upper level, the dependencies between the form data items are taken into account to further", "volume": "8", "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics \\& Technologies", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2004handwritten"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0014-0012", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:gl1b8aaMDw4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHandwritten%2Blaboratory%2Btest%2Border%2Bform%2Brecognition%2Bmodule%2Bfor%2Bdistributed%2Bclinic%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=gl1b8aaMDw4J&ei=sMqgYcKSHYbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1013183089823407490&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:gl1b8aaMDw4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Handwritten+laboratory+test+order+form+recognition+module+for+distributed+clinic&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0014-0012/c/2004_v8_Sas.pdf"}
