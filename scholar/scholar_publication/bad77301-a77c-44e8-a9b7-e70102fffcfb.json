The problem refers to the network survivability and may be considered hard due to its scale. Such problems are usually successfully solved by various Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The recent advances in the development of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) dedicated to solving discrete-encoded problems show that GAs employing modern linkage learning techniques seem to have exceptional potential in proposing high-quality results", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "107864", "volume": "113", "journal": "Applied Soft Computing", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2021empirical"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621007869", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:mlfmw9zeT48J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEmpirical%2Bproblem%2Bdecomposition%25E2%2580%2594the%2Bkey%2Bto%2Bthe%2Bevolutionary%2Beffectiveness%2Bin%2Bsolving%2Ba%2Blarge-scale%2Bnon-binary%2Bdiscrete%2Breal-world%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=mlfmw9zeT48J&ei=69KgYZSvE-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 0}
