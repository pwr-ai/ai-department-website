This paper presents an optimization method for the multi-label classification process for data with a high number of labels. The newly proposed method starts with label grouping using community detection methods on interconnectedness graph of labels based on support sizes for every pair of labels. The grouping process is based on modularity-oriented community detection methods. Next the data instances are classified", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "431--440", "booktitle": "International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "szymanski2013mlg"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40846-5_43", "author_id": ["K8v7ROIAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:RtEaqFx1WDUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMLG:%2BEnchancing%2Bmulti-label%2Bclassification%2Bwith%2Bmodularity-based%2Blabel%2Bgrouping%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=RtEaqFx1WDUJ&ei=CtWgYcTbMePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3843951322778489158&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:RtEaqFx1WDUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=MLG:+Enchancing+multi-label+classification+with+modularity-based+label+grouping&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
