Our method extends the iterative approach to take into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution, the percentage of label pairs", "organization": "PMLR", "pages": "22--35", "booktitle": "First International Workshop on Learning with Imbalanced Domains: Theory and Applications", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "szymanski2017network"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v74/szyma%C5%84ski17a.html", "author_id": ["K8v7ROIAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:UL_UauzUBKgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DA%2Bnetwork%2Bperspective%2Bon%2Bstratification%2Bof%2Bmulti-label%2Bdata%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=UL_UauzUBKgJ&ei=Ro6gYfbyO7GUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 31, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12107035810148433744&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:UL_UauzUBKgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=A+network+perspective+on+stratification+of+multi-label+data&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v74/szyma%C5%84ski17a/szyma%C5%84ski17a.pdf"}
