In order to develop high quality simulation models, methodological approaches are demanded. In such direction we are moving by proposing a heuristic for the formalization of agent based simulation problems. The proposed heuristic is based on some guidelines developed for identifying the main elements of the problem domain description by analysing verbs and their common taxonomy in", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "ganzhaconference"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/223412/405075/2015.%20MAS&S15.pdf", "author_id": ["y9mZCW8AAAAJ", "DnvlyfEAAAAJ", "OWSryNQAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:j4uKL-c4K9sJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DConference%2Bon%2BComputer%2BScience%2Band%2BInformation%2BSystems%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=j4uKL-c4K9sJ&ei=bZ6gYfeQFoGUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:j4uKL-c4K9sJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Conference+on+Computer+Science+and+Information+Systems&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/223412/405075/2015.%20MAS&S15.pdf"}
