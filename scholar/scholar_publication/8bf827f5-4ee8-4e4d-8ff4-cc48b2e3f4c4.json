While surveys are one of the most important tools for research, the representativeness of selected online samples is often a challenge and the results are hardly generalizable. An approach based on surveys with representativeness targeted at network measure distributions is proposed and analyzed in this paper. Its main goal is to focus not only on sample representativeness in terms of", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "685--693", "volume": "51", "journal": "Computers in Human Behavior", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "jankowski2015knowledge"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214007304", "author_id": ["xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 8, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:dQt6JJExqTMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DKnowledge%2Bacquisition%2Bfrom%2Bsocial%2Bplatforms%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bnetwork%2Bdistributions%2Bfitting%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=dQt6JJExqTMJ&ei=CzpeYfiWG8-TmwHPvZGABQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3722561066450422645&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:dQt6JJExqTMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Knowledge+acquisition+from+social+platforms+based+on+network+distributions+fitting&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03049"}
