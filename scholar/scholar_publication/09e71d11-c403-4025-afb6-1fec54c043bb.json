Since the system was created as a wide-scale commercial product, such aspects as speed of translation, ungrammatical texts and time and cost of developing the system are of great importance. An attempt of solving these problems by use of Machine Learning techniques in parsing and tagging is discussed.", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "169--178", "booktitle": "Intelligent Information Processing and Web Mining", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "labuzek2003approach"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-36562-4_18", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:pCzHZ1IAc78J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAn%2BApproach%2Bto%2BRapid%2BDevelopment%2Bof%2BMachine%2BTranslation%2BSystem%2Bfor%2BInternet%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=pCzHZ1IAc78J&ei=iZagYZeHFbGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=13795370437494385828&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:pCzHZ1IAc78J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=An+Approach+to+Rapid+Development+of+Machine+Translation+System+for+Internet&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.2.6052&rep=rep1&type=pdf"}
