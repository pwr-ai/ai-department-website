Diffusion cascades can be triggered by activation of even a small set of nodes. Such activation is commonly performed in a single stage. A novel approach based on sequential seeding is analyzed here resulting in three fundamental contributions. First, we propose a coordinated execution of randomized choices to enable precise comparison of different algorithms in general. We apply it here when the", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group", "pages": "1--9", "number": "1", "volume": "8", "journal": "Scientific reports", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "jankowski2018probing"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32081-2/briefing/signup/", "author_id": ["xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "2OJOZTUAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 20, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:6lFGBh0VpScJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DProbing%2Blimits%2Bof%2Binformation%2Bspread%2Bwith%2Bsequential%2Bseeding%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=6lFGBh0VpScJ&ei=1jReYYWzMsKSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2856712753039954410&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:6lFGBh0VpScJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Probing+limits+of+information+spread+with+sequential+seeding&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32081-2/briefing/signup/"}
