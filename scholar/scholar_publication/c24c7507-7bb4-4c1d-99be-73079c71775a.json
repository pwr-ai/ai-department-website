In this work, we utilize three transformer-based models (XLM-R, HerBERT, mBERT) to improve recognition quality using MTL for selected low-resource language (Polish) and three disjoint sequence labeling tasks with different levels of inter-annotator agreement. Our best MTL model outperforms single-task models both within the tasks domain and overall performance.", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "1132--1140", "volume": "192", "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "radom2021multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921016057", "author_id": ["", "pmQHb5IAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 0, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:FCxzTo8TmsMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti-task%2BSequence%2BClassification%2Bfor%2BDisjoint%2BTasks%2Bin%2BLow-resource%2BLanguages%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=FCxzTo8TmsMJ&ei=8aFdYZXOF86_mQHMm7boDg", "eprint_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050921016057/pdf?md5=3f50e8471556e4db03a605eec87291e5&pid=1-s2.0-S1877050921016057-main.pdf"}
