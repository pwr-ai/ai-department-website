    "abstract": "In the paper, a complete method of text image segmentation into the images of individual characters is proposed. The ultimate aim of the segmentation process is to prepare a set of correctly labeled character samples that can be used to train the character classifier applied as the component of the handwritten word recognizer. The method proposed consists of two stages. At the first stage, the text image is first divided into lines and then the lines are segmented into words. In this phase, the known spelling representation of the text on the",
