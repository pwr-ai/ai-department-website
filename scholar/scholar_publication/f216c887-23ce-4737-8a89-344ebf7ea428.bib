 abstract = {The challenge of influence maximization in social networks is tackled in many settings and scenarios. However, the most explored variant is looking at how to choose a seed set of a given size, that maximizes the number of activated nodes for selected model of social influence. This has been studied mostly in the area of static networks, yet other kinds of networks, such as multilayer or temporal ones, are also in the scope of recent research. In this work we propose and evaluate the measure based on entropy, that investigates how the},
