The algorithm was limited to recognition and classification of Named Entities representing persons. The algorithm was tested on two small Polish domain corpora of stock exchange and police reports. Comparison with the base lines algorithms based on the case of the first letter and a gazetteer is presented. The algorithm expressed 62% precision and 93% recall for the domain of the training data.
