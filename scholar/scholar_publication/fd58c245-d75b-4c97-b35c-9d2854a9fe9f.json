The combination rule is based on member classifiers reliability assessment. The assessment can be based on probabilistic classifier properties or it can use similarity measures individually evaluated for the character currently being recognized. The approach presented here follows soft classification paradigm, where the classifier not merely selects single class, but it provides the vector of support values corresponding to character", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "400--405", "booktitle": "5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications (ISDA'05)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "sas2005combining"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1578818/", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 8, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:pHV0wwUeKvMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCombining%2Bcharacter%2Bclassifiers%2Busing%2Bmember%2Bclassifiers%2Bassessment%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=pHV0wwUeKvMJ&ei=g6hdYZqfBaPZsQKvo78o", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17521850310341195172&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:pHV0wwUeKvMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Combining+character+classifiers+using+member+classifiers+assessment&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
