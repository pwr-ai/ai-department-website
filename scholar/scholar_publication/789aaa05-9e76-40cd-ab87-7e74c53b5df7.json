In this paper, it is shown, that proposed approach solves multi-objective TSP (mTSP) more effectively than other investigated methods, ie, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). The proposed methods use rank and crowding distance (well-known from NSGA-II), combining those mechanisms in a novel, unique way: competing and co-evolving in the evolution process.
