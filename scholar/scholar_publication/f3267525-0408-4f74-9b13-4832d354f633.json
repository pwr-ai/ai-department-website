    "abstract": "In this article we present the result of the recent research in the recognition of events in Polish. Event recognition plays a major role in many natural language processing applications such as question answering or automatic summarization. We adapted TimeML specification (the well known guideline for English) to Polish language. We annotated 540 documents in Polish Corpus of Wroc\u0142aw University of Technology (KPWr) using our specification. Here we describe the results achieved by Liner2 (a machine learning toolkit)",
