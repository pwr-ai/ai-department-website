A new SGCI method for discovering of stable groups was proposed and compared with existing GED method. The experimental studies on a Polish blogosphere service revealed that both methods are able to identify similar evolution events even though both use different concepts. Some differences were demonstrated as well.", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "1201--1206", "booktitle": "2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "gliwa2012identification"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6425593/", "author_id": ["VvXDjFsAAAAJ", "DVE_klAAAAAJ", "gs-Q0xUAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 34, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:vsSiDJxkUH0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DIdentification%2Bof%2BGroup%2BChanges%2Bin%2BBlogosphere%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=vsSiDJxkUH0J&ei=3FNeYbeZMYfBmQGX-6OoBg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=9029827874267514046&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:vsSiDJxkUH0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Identification+of+Group+Changes+in+Blogosphere&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.5171"}
