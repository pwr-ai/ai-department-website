We assume a single-link failure scenario, which is the most common and frequently reported failure event. Since the network flow is modeled as a non-bifurcated multicommodity flow, the discussed optimization problem is NP-complete. Thus, we develop an effective heuristic algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm. The main novelty of this work is that the proposed", "publisher": "Zielona G{\\'o}ra: Uniwersytet Zielonog{\\'o}rski", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2006quasi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://zbc.uz.zgora.pl/Content/57554/AMCS_2006_16_4_6.pdf", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ", "cnLc7u4AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:4s_-ABemYKgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DQuasi-hierarchical%2Bevolution%2Balgorithm%2Bfor%2Bflow%2Bassignment%2Bin%2Bsurvivable%2Bconnection-oriented%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=4s_-ABemYKgJ&ei=-6-gYY_dBsySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12132880013867274210&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:4s_-ABemYKgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Quasi-hierarchical+evolution+algorithm+for+flow+assignment+in+survivable+connection-oriented+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://zbc.uz.zgora.pl/Content/57554/AMCS_2006_16_4_6.pdf"}
