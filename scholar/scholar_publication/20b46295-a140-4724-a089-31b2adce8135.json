    "abstract": "In the paper we discuss the problem of low recall for the named entity (NE) recognition task for Polish. We discuss to what extent the recall of NE recognition can be improved by reducing the space of NE categories. We also present several extensions to the binary model which give an improvement of the recall. The extensions include: new features, application of external knowledge and post-processing. For the partial evaluation the final model obtained 90.02% recall with 91.30% precision on the corpus of economic news.",
