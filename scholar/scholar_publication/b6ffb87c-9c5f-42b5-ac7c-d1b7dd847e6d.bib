 abstract = {This paper presents a supervised approach to the recognition of Crossdocument Structure Theory (CST) relations in Polish texts. Its core is a graphbased representation constructed for sentences. Graphs are built on the basis of lexicalised syntactic-semantic relations extracted from text. Similarity between sentences is calculated as similarity between their graphs, and the values are used as features to train the classifiers. Several different configurations of graphs, as well as graph similarity methods were analysed for this task},
