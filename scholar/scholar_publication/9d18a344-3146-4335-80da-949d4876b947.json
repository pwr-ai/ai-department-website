The proposed architecture of the Polish tagger called TaKIPI created the possibility for using different types of classifiers in tagging, but only C4. 5 Decision Trees were applied initially. The goal of this paper is to explore the range of promising rule based classifiers and to investigate their impact on the accuracy of tagging", "booktitle": "Proceedings of 1st International Symposium Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2006multiclassifier"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/240910583_Multiclassifier_Approach_to_Tagging_of_Polish/links/0046352a96babe4a01000000/Multiclassifier-Approach-to-Tagging-of-Polish.pdf", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:qtBVts5-Ie0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulticlassifier%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Btagging%2Bof%2BPolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=qtBVts5-Ie0J&ei=qMSgYZ2BHbGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17087077887507812522&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:qtBVts5-Ie0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multiclassifier+approach+to+tagging+of+Polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maciej-Piasecki/publication/240910583_Multiclassifier_Approach_to_Tagging_of_Polish/links/0046352a96babe4a01000000/Multiclassifier-Approach-to-Tagging-of-Polish.pdf"}
