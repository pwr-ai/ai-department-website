    "abstract": "In the Evolutionary Computation field, it is frequent to assume that a computation load necessary for fitness value computation is, at least, similar for all possible cases. The main objective of this paper is to show that the above assumption is frequently false. Therefore, the examples of evolutionary methods that use problem encoding which allows for significant optimization of the fitness computation process are pointed out and analyzed.
