We use the bibliographic information available in the DBLP database to extract candidate phrases from scientific paper abstracts. Following that, we construct citation networks based on direct citation, co-citation and bibliographic coupling relationships between the papers. The candidate research topics, in the form of keyphrases and n-grammes, are subsequently ranked and", "publisher": "SAGE Publications Sage UK: London, England", "pages": "0165551520962775", "journal": "Journal of Information Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kleminski2020analysis"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551520962775", "author_id": ["9A-CgPgAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 5, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:D1NP2haBL74J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAnalysis%2Bof%2Bdirect%2Bcitation,%2Bco-citation%2Band%2Bbibliographic%2Bcoupling%2Bin%2Bscientific%2Btopic%2Bidentification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,44&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=D1NP2haBL74J&ei=HJVdYfqHGsKSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=13704314126263603983&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:D1NP2haBL74J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Analysis+of+direct+citation,+co-citation+and+bibliographic+coupling+in+scientific+topic+identification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44"}
