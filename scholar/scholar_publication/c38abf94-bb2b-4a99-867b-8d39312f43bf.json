PPM is based on the premise that knowledge domain is already defined by knowledge engineer (ie names for classes, attributes, values etc.). The definitions are automatically translated from natural language into formal expressions stored partially in knowledge base and partially in semantic dictionary. PPM preserves composi-tionality principle and is based on sublanguage method.
