In the paper a new distance measure for training set selection is presented and thoroughly discussed. The distance between two datasets is computed using variance of entropy in groups obtained after clustering. The approach is validated using real domain datasets from debt portfolio valuation process. Eventually, prediction performance is examined.", "publisher": "IGI Global", "pages": "60--69", "number": "2", "volume": "7", "journal": "International Journal of Information Technology and Web Engineering (IJITWE)", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2012new"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.igi-global.com/article/content/70386", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:41f-9pRX6q8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DNew%2BEntropy%2BBased%2BDistance%2Bfor%2BTraining%2BSet%2BSelection%2Bin%2BDebt%2BPortfolio%2BValuation%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=41f-9pRX6q8J&ei=G6mgYbDaOcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:41f-9pRX6q8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=New+Entropy+Based+Distance+for+Training+Set+Selection+in+Debt+Portfolio+Valuation&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~kajdanowicz/pubs/Kajdanowicz_2012_New%20Entropy%20Based%20Distance%20for%20Training%20Set%20Selection%20in%20Debt%20Portfolio%20Valuation.pdf"}
