As a part of the Regional Center for Cybersecurity initiative, a three-stage machine learning network security solution is being developed and will be deployed in March 2021. The solution consists of prevention, monitoring, and curation stages. As prevention, we utilize Natural Language Processing to extract the security-related information from social media, news portals, and darknet. A deep learning architecture is used to monitor the network in", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "1097--1104", "booktitle": "2020 IEEE 19th International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (TrustCom)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "saganowski2020three"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9343002/", "author_id": ["DVE_klAAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 0, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:5-r0Kh36dooJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DA%2Bthree-stage%2Bmachine%2Blearning%2Bnetwork%2Bsecurity%2Bsolution%2Bfor%2Bpublic%2Bentities%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=5-r0Kh36dooJ&ei=IVReYZn6Gou4mAGqg5LoDg", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:5-r0Kh36dooJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=A+three-stage+machine+learning+network+security+solution+for+public+entities&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
