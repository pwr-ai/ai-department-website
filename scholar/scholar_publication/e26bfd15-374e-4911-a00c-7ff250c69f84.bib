 abstract = {A method for extraction of the multi-layered social network based on the data about human collaborative achievements, in particular scientific papers, is presented in the paper. The objects linking people form a hierarchy, which is flattened in the pre-processing stage. Only one level of the hierarchy remains together with new activities moved from its other levels. Separate layers of the multi-layered social network are created based on these pre-processed activities.},
