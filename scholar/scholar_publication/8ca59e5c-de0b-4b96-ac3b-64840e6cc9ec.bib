 abstract = {The paper presents a method of information extraction from overview maps. The idea is based on recognizing text located on the map and on finding locations corresponding to the extracted text labels using the GeoNames ontology. The method consists of three phases. The first one performs map image processing in order to recognize text labels. The next phase verifies these labels and marks them as being sure or unsure locations. In the third phase the map is interpreted based on the locations found. The second and third phases},
