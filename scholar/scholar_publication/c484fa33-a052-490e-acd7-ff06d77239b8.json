In such a network each pair of nodes may be linked by many edges that correspond to different communication or collaboration user activities. Multi-layered degree centrality for multi-layered social networks is presented in the paper. Experimental studies were carried out on data collected from the real Web 2.0 site. The multi-layered social network extracted from this data consists of ten distinct layers and the network", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "237--242", "booktitle": "2011 International Conference on Computational Aspects of Social Networks (CASoN)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "brodka2011degree"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6085951/", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:go5rBRBQKKAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DA%2Bdegree%2Bcentrality%2Bin%2Bmulti-layered%2Bsocial%2Bnetwork%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=go5rBRBQKKAJ&ei=V7CgYe21O-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 71, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=11540562074877529730&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:go5rBRBQKKAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=A+degree+centrality+in+multi-layered+social+network&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.5184.pdf;"}
