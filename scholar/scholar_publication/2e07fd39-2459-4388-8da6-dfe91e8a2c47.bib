 abstract = {Hybrid and ensemble methods in machine learning have attracted a great attention of the scientific community over the last years [Zhou, 12]. Multiple, ensemble learning models have been theoretically and empirically shown to provide significantly better performance than single weak learners, especially while dealing with high dimensional, complex regression and classification problems [Brazdil, 09],[Okun, 08]. Adaptive hybrid systems has become essential in computational intelligence and soft computing, as being able to deal with},
