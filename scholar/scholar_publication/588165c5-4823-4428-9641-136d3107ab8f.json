Strategy model in approach is based on two decision trees, responsible for taking the decisions of opening long or short positions on Euro/US Dollar currency pair. Trees take into consideration only technical analysis indicators, which are connected by logic operators to identify border values of these indicators for taking profitable decision (s).
