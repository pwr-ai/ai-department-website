Short word deletion errors appear to be a frequent error type in Polish speech recognition. The proposed speech recognition process consists of two stages. At the first stage the utterance is recognized by a typical speech recognizer based on forward bigram language model. At the second stage the word sequence recognized by the first stage recognizer is analyzed and such pairs of adjacent words in the recognized", "volume": "15", "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics \\& Technologies", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2010application"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0017-0020", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:-uu9LRIxmFcJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DApplication%2Bof%2Blocal%2Bbidirectional%2Blanguage%2Bmodel%2Bto%2Berror%2Bcorrection%2Bin%2BPolish%2Bmedical%2Bspeech%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=-uu9LRIxmFcJ&ei=6rugYafDHIGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6311848831906343930&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:-uu9LRIxmFcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Application+of+local+bidirectional+language+model+to+error+correction+in+Polish+medical+speech+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0017-0020/c/2010_v15_Sas.pdf"}
