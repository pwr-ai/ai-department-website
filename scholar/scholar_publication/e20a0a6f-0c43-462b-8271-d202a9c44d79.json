Each such context (channel) may represent a different communication method or a different environment of a given person. This facilitates building multiple social networks, that are not independent. They share the same set of nodes connected with many links grounded on different layers-these networks are called multi-layered or multiplex social", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "499--505", "booktitle": "2013 International Conference on Signal-Image Technology \\& Internet-Based Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "michalski2013convince"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6727235/", "author_id": ["xMVnv3sAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:d8J5L1Uqdh8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DConvince%2Ba%2Bdozen%2Bmore%2Band%2Bsucceed--the%2Binfluence%2Bin%2Bmulti-layered%2Bsocial%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=d8J5L1Uqdh8J&ei=ba6gYYq2KYbQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2267046007784718967&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:d8J5L1Uqdh8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Convince+a+dozen+more+and+succeed--the+influence+in+multi-layered+social+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.ii.pwr.wroc.pl/~michalski/publications/pub_2013_sitis.pdf"}
