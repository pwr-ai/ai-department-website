 abstract = {A word-to-word similarity function automatically extracted from a corpus of texts can be a very helpful tool in automatic extraction of lexical semantic relations. There are many approaches for English, but only a few for inflective languages with almost free word order. In the paper a method for the construction of a similarity function for Polish nouns is proposed. The method uses only simple tools for language processing (eg it does need the application of a parser). The core is the construction of a matrix of co-occurrences of nouns},
