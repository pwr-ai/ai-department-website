 abstract = {Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context of the sentiment analysis domain. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive studies of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. We want to fill this gap and propose a comparison with ablation analysis of Aspect Term Extraction using various text embeddings methods. We particularly focused on simple architectures based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with optional conditional random field (CRF) enhancement using different pre-trained word embeddings},
