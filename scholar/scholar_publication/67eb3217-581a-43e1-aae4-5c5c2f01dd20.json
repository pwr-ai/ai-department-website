Proposed work proposes a specific greedy\u2013based local search and schedule constructor specialised to MS-RCPSP. The GRASP is presented as the better option to classical heuristic but also as a faster and successful alternative to another metaheuristic. To compare results of GRASP to others approaches, various methods are proposed: methods", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "402--411", "booktitle": "International Conference on Computational Collective Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "myszkowski2016grasp"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45243-2_37", "author_id": ["63xKDRcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:_rVMBaX2omUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DGRASP%2Bapplied%2Bto%2Bmulti%25E2%2580%2593skill%2Bresource%25E2%2580%2593constrained%2Bproject%2Bscheduling%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=_rVMBaX2omUJ&ei=ENWgYbLTMrGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 13, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7323687132676797950&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:_rVMBaX2omUJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=GRASP+applied+to+multi%E2%80%93skill+resource%E2%80%93constrained+project+scheduling+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
