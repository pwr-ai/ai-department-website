We have proposed hybrid approach that links classical heuristic priority rules for project scheduling with ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, a novel approach for updating pheromone value has been proposed based on both the best and worst solutions stored by ants. The objective of this paper is to research the usability and robustness of ACO and its", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "3599--3619", "number": "12", "volume": "19", "journal": "Soft Computing", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "myszkowski2015hybrid"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1455-x", "author_id": ["63xKDRcAAAAJ", "", "rDrvnsQAAAAJ", ""], "num_citations": 91, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:4DvRK-zh6EgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DHybrid%2Bant%2Bcolony%2Boptimization%2Bin%2Bsolving%2Bmulti-skill%2Bresource-constrained%2Bproject%2Bscheduling%2Bproblem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=4DvRK-zh6EgJ&ei=tlReYaKLN8KSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=5253697369791347680&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:4DvRK-zh6EgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Hybrid+ant+colony+optimization+in+solving+multi-skill+resource-constrained+project+scheduling+problem&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-014-1455-x"}
