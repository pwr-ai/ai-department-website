This method consists of two steps. First we employ our own method (called frequentiment) for automatic generation of sentiment lexicons and some of publicly available lexicons. Secondly, an ensemble classification is used to improve the overall accuracy of predictions. Our approach outperforms publicly available sentiment lexicons and automatically generated domain lexicons.
