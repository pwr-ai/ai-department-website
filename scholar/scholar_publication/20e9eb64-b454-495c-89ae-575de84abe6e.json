It combines large vocabulary, real-time speech recognition, transcript refinement, and entity and intent recognition in order to convert live audio into a rich, actionable stream of structured events. These events can be further leveraged with a business rules engine, thus serving as a foundation for real-time supervision and assistance applications.
