First, we study associations between MWEs and the structure of wordnet lexico-semantic relations. A simple method of splitting plWordNet's MWEs into compositional and non-compositional on the basis of the hypernymy structure is discussed. However, our main goal is to build a classifier for the recognition of compositional MWEs. We assume prior MWE detection. Several experiments with different classification algorithms were performed", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "240--251", "booktitle": "Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kkedzia2013recognising"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-45114-0_19", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:2yisapX4WssJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRecognising%2Bcompositionality%2Bof%2Bmulti-word%2Bexpressions%2Bin%2Bthe%2Bwordnet%2Boriented%2Bperspective%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=2yisapX4WssJ&ei=wbugYaiqBcySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14653297658226813147&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:2yisapX4WssJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Recognising+compositionality+of+multi-word+expressions+in+the+wordnet+oriented+perspective&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
