 abstract = {The paper presents an agent called Learning Assistant, which is responsible for defining individual learning paths for pupils in e-learning environment. The Assistant is able to infer using metadata described pupils and didactic materials; this inference is a basis for building the individual learning path for each pupil. To build a learning path for a new pupil the agent uses information collected during introductory tests. A SOM neural network is used for grouping similar pupils. WebTeacher is e-learning environment in which Learning Assistant},
