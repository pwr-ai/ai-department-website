We have adapted to Polish the well-known algorithm of Clustering by Committee, and tested it on very large Polish corpora. The evaluation by means of a WordNet-based synonymy test used Polish wordnet (plWordNet 1.0). Various clustering algorithms were analysed for the needs of extraction of document clusters as indicators of the senses of words which occur in them. The two approaches to wordsense identification", "pages": "401--420", "volume": "39", "journal": "Control and Cybernetics", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "broda2010extraction"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://www.control.ibspan.waw.pl:3000/contents/export?filename=2010-2-05_broda_et_al.pdf", "author_id": ["pulMdOUAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "num_citations": 5, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:mCeU489k_6UJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DExtraction%2Bof%2BPolish%2Bnoun%2Bsenses%2Bfrom%2Blarge%2Bcorpora%2Bby%2Bmeans%2Bof%2Bclustering%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=mCeU489k_6UJ&ei=bbxdYcqFB42UmQGz6rqYBQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=11961389979358472088&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:mCeU489k_6UJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Extraction+of+Polish+noun+senses+from+large+corpora+by+means+of+clustering&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.control.ibspan.waw.pl:3000/contents/export?filename=2010-2-05_broda_et_al.pdf"}
