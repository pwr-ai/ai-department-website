Its construction is based on an expanded RNN-based neural network adapted to the work on noisy texts. Among several techniques, the tagger utilises fastText embedding vectors, sequential character embedding vectors, and Brown clustering for the coarse-grained representation of sentence structures. In addition a set of manually written rules was proposed for post-processing. The system was trained to disambiguate", "pages": "1295--1303", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing (RANLP 2019)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "walentynowicz2019tagger"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1148/", "author_id": ["GMmMbaoAAAAJ", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "1QVBEYYAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:u-_bPwD8cBAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTagger%2Bfor%2Bpolish%2Bcomputer%2Bmediated%2Bcommunication%2Btexts%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=u-_bPwD8cBAJ&ei=Pp2gYfPRFePUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1184723780000018363&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:u-_bPwD8cBAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Tagger+for+polish+computer+mediated+communication+texts&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R19-1148.pdf"}
