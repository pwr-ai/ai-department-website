The research aims to create functional computational design tool for architects, mimicking the workflow of architectural design process. The article includes explanation of the proposed approach: problem representation, genetic algorithm operators, fitness functions definitions, post processing operations, software functionalities and workflow as well as achieved architectural results and outline of future research.", "publisher": "CUMINCAD", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "nisztuk2019tool"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://papers.cumincad.org/cgi-bin/works/paper/ecaadesigradi2019_453", "author_id": ["VXfrekQAAAAJ", "63xKDRcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:oa221kxslygJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DTool%2Bfor%2Bevolutionary%2Baided%2Barchitectural%2Bdesign.%2BHybrid%2BEvolutionary%2BAlgorithm%2Bapplied%2Bto%2BMulti-Objective%2BAutomated%2BFloor%2BPlan%2BGeneration%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=oa221kxslygJ&ei=ZsCgYcrpOuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2924925560276037025&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:oa221kxslygJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Tool+for+evolutionary+aided+architectural+design.+Hybrid+Evolutionary+Algorithm+applied+to+Multi-Objective+Automated+Floor+Plan+Generation&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://papers.cumincad.org/data/works/att/ecaadesigradi2019_453.pdf"}
