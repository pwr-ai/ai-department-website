Based on interconnected spam and no-spam hosts a collective classification approach based on label propagation is aimed at discovering the spam hosts. Each host is represented as network node and links between hosts constitute network's edges. The proposed method provides reasonable results and is able to compute large data as is settled in MapReduce programming model.", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "197--206", "booktitle": "International Joint Conference CISIS\u201912-ICEUTE{\\'{}} 12-SOCO{\\'{}} 12 Special Sessions", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "indyk2013web"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33018-6_20", "author_id": ["HvA-UicAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cfZOhU5bGj4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DWeb%2Bspam%2Bdetection%2Busing%2BMapReduce%2Bapproach%2Bto%2Bcollective%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=cfZOhU5bGj4J&ei=KZOgYe2vG8ySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 12, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4474989572548130417&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cfZOhU5bGj4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Web+spam+detection+using+MapReduce+approach+to+collective+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~kajdanowicz/pubs/Indyk_2012_Web%20Spam%20Detection%20Using%20MapReduce%20Approach%20to%20Collective%20Classification.pdf"}
