The objects linking people form a hierarchy, which is flattened in the pre-processing stage. Only one level of the hierarchy remains together with new activities moved from its other levels. Separate layers of the multi-layered social network are created based on these pre-processed activities.", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "407--412", "booktitle": "2010 IEEE Second International Conference on Social Computing", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kazienko2010multi"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5591277/", "author_id": ["cxLgNccAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ", "Dw5QS9wAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cBXdbfx7OBcJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMulti-layered%2Bsocial%2Bnetwork%2Bcreation%2Bbased%2Bon%2Bbibliographic%2Bdata%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=cBXdbfx7OBcJ&ei=O7CgYfeoIIiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 35, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1673223585673319792&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cBXdbfx7OBcJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multi-layered+social+network+creation+based+on+bibliographic+data&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.kkio.pwr.wroc.pl/~brodka/art/2010_SocialCom.pdf"}
