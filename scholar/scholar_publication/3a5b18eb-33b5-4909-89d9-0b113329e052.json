It shows, that guiding the evolution process towards the least explored parts of a space increases overall diversity, but can also lead to increased convergence. A set of experiments is carried out on a many-objective Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem and a bi-objective Travelling Thief Problem.
