 abstract = {The task of determining labels of all network nodes based on the knowledge about network structure and labels of some training subset of nodes is called the within-network classification. It may happen that none of the labels of the nodes is known and additionally there is no information about number of classes to which nodes can be assigned. In such a case a subset of nodes has to be selected for initial label acquisition. The question that arises is:" labels of which nodes should be collected and used for learning in order to},
