 abstract = {A social network is an abstract concept consisting of set of people and relationships linking pairs of humans. A new multidimensional model, which covers three main dimensions: relation layer, time window and group, is proposed in the paper. These dimensions have a common set of nodes, typically, corresponding to human beings. Relation layers, in turn, reflect various relationship types extracted from different user activities gathered in computer systems. The time dimension corresponds to temporal variability of the social network},
