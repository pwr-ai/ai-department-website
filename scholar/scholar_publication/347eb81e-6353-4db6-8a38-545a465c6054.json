Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are those that have recently gained a considerable amount of interest. This is an introductory article to this topic. It gives an overview of several types of detectable attacks, symptoms that help in intrusion detection, describes IDS tasks, different architectures and concepts in this field.", "number": "2009", "volume": "20", "journal": "Retrieved April", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "kazienko2003intrusion"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ftp.tex-host.ru/Security/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D1%8B/Reading/08%20IDS/IDS%20part%201.pdf", "author_id": ["cxLgNccAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:E6jLj2Z6AHQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DIntrusion%2BDetection%2BSystems%2B(IDS)%2BPart%2BI-(network%2Bintrusions%253B%2Battack%2Bsymptoms%253B%2BIDS%2Btasks%253B%2Band%2BIDS%2Barchitecture)%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=E6jLj2Z6AHQJ&ei=vMqgYcunLuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 39, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=8358815489317382163&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:E6jLj2Z6AHQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Intrusion+Detection+Systems+(IDS)+Part+I-(network+intrusions%3B+attack+symptoms%3B+IDS+tasks%3B+and+IDS+architecture)&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://ftp.tex-host.ru/Security/%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5%20%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB%D1%8B/Reading/08%20IDS/IDS%20part%201.pdf"}
