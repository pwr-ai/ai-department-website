 abstract = {It is a common problem that cost of extracting data for network analysis could be very high. Also sometimes in the Internet is it hard to find graph with desired features such as node degree or clustering level. Because of that graph generators can than be very helpful. In the past bunch of models of such generators was developed: random graphs, small worlds and scale free networks. All of these generators were developed to quickly and efficiently create networks with desired parameters. However all of this models produce single layer graphs},
