In this paper, we consider discrete-time dynamic graph representation learning, where embeddings are computed for each time window, and then are aggregated to represent the dynamics of a graph. However, independently computed embeddings in consecutive windows suffer from the stochastic nature of representation learning algorithms and are algebraically incomparable.
