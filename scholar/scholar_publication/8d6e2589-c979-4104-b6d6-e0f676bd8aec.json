A hypothesis is tested which states that statistical distributions in the entire corpus and in its sub-corpora are different with regard to type and/or parameter values (in case of similar models). The research was carried out on the material of a balanced corpus of Polish using NLP programming tools prepared in the framework of the CLARIN-PL consortium.
