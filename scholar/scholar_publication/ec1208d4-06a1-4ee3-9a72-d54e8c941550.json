We focus on the data mining classification task and we propose evolutionary algorithm for rule extraction. Presented approach is based on binary classical genetic algorithm with representation ofif-then'rules and we propose two specialized genetic operators. We want to show that some search space reduction techniques make possible to get solution comparable to others from", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "73--79", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "myszkowski2010coevolutionary"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5679728/", "author_id": ["63xKDRcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:3dA8iQ22eG4J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DCoevolutionary%2Balgorithm%2Bfor%2Brule%2Binduction%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=3dA8iQ22eG4J&ei=qL2gYdaNJYGUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 4, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7960312510630645981&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:3dA8iQ22eG4J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Coevolutionary+algorithm+for+rule+induction&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pawel-Myszkowski-2/publication/261487654_Coevolutionary_Algorithm_For_Rule_Induction/links/00b7d5362b912e1221000000/Coevolutionary-Algorithm-For-Rule-Induction.pdf"}
