From those data the social network can be created. Additionally, because usually also time and dates of this activities are stored, the dynamic of such network can be analyzed by splitting it into many timeframes representing the state of the network during specific period of time. One of the most interesting issue is group evolution over time. To track group evolution the GED method can be used. However, choice of the timeframe type and length might have great", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "679--683", "booktitle": "2012 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "saganowski2012influence"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6425691/", "author_id": ["DVE_klAAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:MwxEdMphTGsJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bthe%2BDynamic%2BSocial%2BNetwork%2BTimeframe%2BType%2Band%2BSize%2Bon%2Bthe%2BGroup%2BEvolution%2BDiscovery%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,33&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=MwxEdMphTGsJ&ei=zMegYdSSLOPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 18, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7731662182450203699&as_sdt=5,33&sciodt=0,33&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:MwxEdMphTGsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Influence+of+the+Dynamic+Social+Network+Timeframe+Type+and+Size+on+the+Group+Evolution+Discovery&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.5167"}
