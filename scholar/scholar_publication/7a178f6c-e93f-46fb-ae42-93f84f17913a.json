More than 150 practising architects from Poland and abroad took part in the survey. Survey results were then extracted, ordered and interpreted with the use of data mining. The survey structure, methodology and analytical tools used are described in the paper.", "pages": "73--89", "number": "1", "volume": "15", "journal": "Teka Komisji Architektury, Urbanistyki i Studi{\\'o}w Krajobrazowych", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "nisztuk2019design"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ph.pollub.pl/index.php/teka/article/view/1334", "author_id": ["VXfrekQAAAAJ", "Fq5OycAAAAAJ", "63xKDRcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:GuyDQS8c2uMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DDesign%2Bguidelines%2Bfor%2Bautomated%2Bfloor%2Bplan%2Bgeneration%2Bapplications%25E2%2580%2593target%2Bgroup%2Bsurvey,%2Bresults%2Band%2Breflections%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=GuyDQS8c2uMJ&ei=wK-gYeeaG-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:GuyDQS8c2uMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Design+guidelines+for+automated+floor+plan+generation+applications%E2%80%93target+group+survey,+results+and+reflections&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://ph.pollub.pl/index.php/teka/article/download/1334/1648"}
