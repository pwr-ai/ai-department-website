The results published so far show that P3 effectiveness is low when bimodal trap problems are in use. Therefore, Parameter-less Population Pyramid with Feedback (fP3) was proposed. fP3 extends P3 by the feedback operation which improves P3's effectiveness when bimodal trap problems are used. However, fP3 is no longer a", "pages": "312--313", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "zielinski2019parameter"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319619.3322052", "author_id": ["", ""], "num_citations": 5, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:VRbAEZGFsQoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DParameter-less%2Bpopulation%2Bpyramid%2Bwith%2Bautomatic%2Bfeedback%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=VRbAEZGFsQoJ&ei=VUReYbrCIM-TmwHPvZGABQ", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=770543869371618901&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:VRbAEZGFsQoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Parameter-less+population+pyramid+with+automatic+feedback&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
