We propose an automatic method of associating a stand-alone proper name repository with a wordnet. A variety of sources of lexical-semantic knowledge can be harnessed into this task. Semantic proximity between a proper name and a synset can be based on pattern-driven search and on distributional analyses in large corpora. The sources are heterogeneous and the measures of semantic relatedness vary", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "65--85", "booktitle": "Computational Linguistics", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "kurc2013automatic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-34399-5_4", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "mFbRWwMAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:cIC4KipTDy0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAutomatic%2BConstruction%2Bof%2Ba%2BDynamic%2BThesaurus%2Bfor%2BProper%2BNames%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=cIC4KipTDy0J&ei=-aigYb3YEemGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=3246905296927883376&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:cIC4KipTDy0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Automatic+Construction+of+a+Dynamic+Thesaurus+for+Proper+Names&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
