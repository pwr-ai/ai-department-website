Depending on the definition of a matrix, one can contemplate graph energy, Randi\u0107 energy, Laplacian energy, distance energy, and many others. Although theoretical properties of various graph energies have been investigated in the past in the areas of mathematics, chemistry, physics, or graph theory, these explorations have been limited to relatively small graphs representing chemical", "publisher": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute", "pages": "916", "number": "12", "volume": "20", "journal": "Entropy", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "morzy2018graph"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/373582", "author_id": ["UwvCguQAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Xjj21gW-kN8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DGraph%2BEnergies%2Bof%2BEgocentric%2BNetworks%2Band%2BTheir%2BCorrelation%2Bwith%2BVertex%2BCentrality%2BMeasures%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=Xjj21gW-kN8J&ei=RLugYaT4LIGUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16109584799394838622&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Xjj21gW-kN8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Graph+Energies+of+Egocentric+Networks+and+Their+Correlation+with+Vertex+Centrality+Measures&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/20/12/916/pdf"}
