However, successful combination of hand-written rules and a stochastic approach to Czech, as well, as some initial experiments in acquisition of tagging rules for Polish revealed potential capabilities of a rule based approach. The goals are: to define a language of tagging constraints, to construct a set of reduction rules for Polish and to apply Machine Learning to extraction of tagging rules.
