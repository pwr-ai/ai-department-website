We introduce a simple model, which uses the priority attachment to generate both synthetic and close to empirical networks. Priority attachment is a mechanism, which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world networks. In this paper, we show that by using priority attachment we can generate networks of very diverse topologies, as", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group", "pages": "1--19", "number": "1", "volume": "9", "journal": "Scientific reports", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "morzy2019priority"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40015-9", "author_id": ["UwvCguQAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ", "78Bdc40AAAAJ"], "num_citations": 1, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Lvs4CoWjiOwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DPriority%2BAttachment:%2Ba%2BComprehensive%2BMechanism%2Bfor%2BGenerating%2BNetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=Lvs4CoWjiOwJ&ei=JZZdYciTJsKSy9YPu-2n8AU", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17044052581581126446&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Lvs4CoWjiOwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Priority+Attachment:+a+Comprehensive+Mechanism+for+Generating+Networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-40015-9"}
