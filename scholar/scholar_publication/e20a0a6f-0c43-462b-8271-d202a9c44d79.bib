 abstract = {Humans utilise multiple communication channels in their social interactions and also information diffusion as well as the spread of influence are practically related with many contexts. Each such context (channel) may represent a different communication method or a different environment of a given person. This facilitates building multiple social networks, that are not independent. They share the same set of nodes connected with many links grounded on different layers-these networks are called multi-layered or multiplex social},
