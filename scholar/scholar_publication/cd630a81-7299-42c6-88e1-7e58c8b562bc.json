Although the majority of research in this area is based on measures of distributional similarity calculated from co-occurrences of words in large collections of documents, we wanted to approach a difficult problem of meaning ambiguity resolution from a different direction. During the research we have faced and addressed several problems of keyword extraction from document groups", "organization": "Citeseer", "pages": "203--212", "booktitle": "Proc. of the 16th Int.
