 abstract = {One of the main evolutionary algorithms bottlenecks is the significant effectiveness dropdown caused by increasing number of genes necessary for coding the problem solution. In this paper, we present a multi population pattern searching algorithm (MuPPetS), which is supposed to be an answer to situations where long coded individuals are a must. MuPPetS uses some of the messy GA ideas like coding and operators. The presented algorithm uses the binary coding, however the objective is to use MuPPetS against real-life},
