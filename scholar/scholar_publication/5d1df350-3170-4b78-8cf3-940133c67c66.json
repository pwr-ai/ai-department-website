The parser loosely preserves the shift-reduce scheme, enriched with powerful actions, and a compound Decision Tree instead of the decision table. The attempt originates directly from Hermjakob's ideas [3], but an important goal was to analyse possible extensions to a wide scale solution. Several supporting heuristics, as well as the overview of the development process and experiments, are", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "503--510", "booktitle": "Intelligent Information Processing and Web Mining", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "labuzek2005deep"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-32392-9_61", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:NnZhUovsaT8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DDeep%2BParser%2Bfor%2BFree%2BEnglish%2BTexts%2BBased%2Bon%2BMachine%2BLearning%2Bwith%2BLimited%2BResources%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=NnZhUovsaT8J&ei=eamgYfqlCOPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:NnZhUovsaT8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Deep+Parser+for+Free+English+Texts+Based+on+Machine+Learning+with+Limited+Resources&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://ndl.ethernet.edu.et/bitstream/123456789/48854/1/Mieczys%C5%82aw%20A.%20K%C5%82opotek_2005.pdf#page=505"}
