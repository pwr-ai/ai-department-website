In previous work authors provided that the classification of the element in the output structure can be performed using standard input of the instance (its profile) as well as all other preceding output elements (already classified) as learning attributes. Now they present how the order of the score function application to each element of output space is important and may determine the overall", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "221--228", "booktitle": "International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2011structured"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21222-2_27", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:KW2gR1Ro5VQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DStructured%2Boutput%2Belement%2Bordering%2Bin%2Bboosting-based%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=KW2gR1Ro5VQJ&ei=aZ-gYcKfMobQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 3, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=6117410380040924457&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:KW2gR1Ro5VQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Structured+output+element+ordering+in+boosting-based+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
