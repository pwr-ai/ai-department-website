Numerous methods have been proposed to cope with this problem; however, even state-of-the-art methods offer a limited improvement (if any) for data sets with critically under-represented minority classes. For such problematic cases, an \u201coutside the box\u201d solution is required. Therefore, we propose a novel technique, called enrichment, which uses the information (observations) from the external data set (s)", "publisher": "IEEE", "pages": "125191--125209", "volume": "8", "journal": "IEEE Access", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "jegierski2020outside"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9136875/", "author_id": ["", "DVE_klAAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:a2NVcdoW_zgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DAn%2B%25E2%2580%259Coutside%2Bthe%2Bbox%25E2%2580%259D%2Bsolution%2Bfor%2Bimbalanced%2Bdata%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=a2NVcdoW_zgJ&ei=ZZ6gYeidO4GUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4107026512645284715&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:a2NVcdoW_zgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=An+%E2%80%9Coutside+the+box%E2%80%9D+solution+for+imbalanced+data+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/8948470/09136875.pdf"}
