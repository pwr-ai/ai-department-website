However, the other important issue is to find a solution efficiently. Therefore, evolutionary methods use various techniques to adjust to the problem and reduce the amount of resources consumed during an optimization process. One of the well-known and relatively simple techniques is storing the already evaluated genotypes and their ratings. Whenever an evolutionary method is to evaluate the fitness for a genotype that was", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "1785--1791", "booktitle": "2021 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "przewozniczek2021fitness"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9504686/?casa_token=MjR315Dk8R0AAAAA:2ZVyVcRZHzLvcXRLEIl1vfp1ngNjwBytUkQju6FKE8PzgnMgK0P71TQsfUxKwvXvdqxfFfU9GaQ", "author_id": ["bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:ZsAvIxrIwUUJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DFitness%2BCaching-From%2Ba%2BMinor%2BMechanism%2Bto%2BMajor%2BConsequences%2Bin%2BModern%2BEvolutionary%2BComputation%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=ZsAvIxrIwUUJ&ei=xaqgYfbxOOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 0, "eprint_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/9504682/9504683/09504686.pdf?casa_token=KODq_VyW_6oAAAAA:wKqgBw9TUqyXC9ZZ_V_HNF9n-EuUMACXtUdAr2VSyVTTYL367VAOU6wsHBUbj0tSkWZ5zNdviKY"}
