    "abstract": "In the field of Evolutionary Computation, the main objective is to find a high-quality solution to the considered problem. However, the other important issue is to find a solution efficiently. Therefore, evolutionary methods use various techniques to adjust to the problem and reduce the amount of resources consumed during an optimization process. One of the well-known and relatively simple techniques is storing the already evaluated genotypes and their ratings. Whenever an evolutionary method is to evaluate the fitness for a genotype that was",
