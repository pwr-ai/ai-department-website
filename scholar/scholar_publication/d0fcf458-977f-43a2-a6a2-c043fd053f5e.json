Whereas most solutions are based on single-stage seeding at the beginning of the process, performance increases when additional seeds are used. This enables the acquisition of knowledge about ongoing processes and activating new nodes for further influence maximisation. This paper describes an approach based on the Vote-Rank algorithm with dynamic rankings for sequential seed selection.
