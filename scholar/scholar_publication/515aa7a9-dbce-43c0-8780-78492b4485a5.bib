 abstract = {A method for the recognition of the compositionality of Multi Word Expressions (MWEs) is proposed. First, we study associations between MWEs and the structure of wordnet lexico-semantic relations. A simple method of splitting plWordNet's MWEs into compositional and non-compositional on the basis of the hypernymy structure is discussed. However, our main goal is to build a classifier for the recognition of compositional MWEs. We assume prior MWE detection. Several experiments with different classification algorithms were performed},
