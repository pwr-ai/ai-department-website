Most popularly used bigram word-based language models allow for highly accurate speech recognition but need large amount of memory to store, mainly due to the big number of word bigrams. The method proposed here ranks bigrams according to their importance in speech recognition and replaces explicit estimation of less important bigrams probabilities by probabilities derived from the class", "volume": "20", "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics \\& Technologies", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2012building"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0027-0013", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:KkOXTeaBzjwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DBuilding%2Bcompact%2Blanguage%2Bmodels%2Bfor%2Bmedical%2Bspeech%2Brecognition%2Bin%2Bmobile%2Bdevices%2Bwith%2Blimited%2Bamount%2Bof%2Bmemory%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=KkOXTeaBzjwJ&ei=2tagYa3rEIiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:KkOXTeaBzjwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Building+compact+language+models+for+medical+speech+recognition+in+mobile+devices+with+limited+amount+of+memory&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0027-0013/c/2012_v20_Sas.pdf"}
