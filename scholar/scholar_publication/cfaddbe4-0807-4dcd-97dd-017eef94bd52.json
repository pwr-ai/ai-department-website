In many cases, they are helpful in modeling processes that happen on top of them, which leads to gaining more knowledge about these phenomena. One example of such a process is the spread of influence. Here, the members of a social system spread the influence across the network by contacting each other, sharing", "publisher": "AIP Publishing LLC", "pages": "033130", "number": "3", "volume": "31", "journal": "Chaos: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Nonlinear Science", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "brodka2021sequential"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0023427", "author_id": ["T7v65jEAAAAJ", "xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "xMVnv3sAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:_HE-olNHOAwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DSequential%2Bseeding%2Bin%2Bmultilayer%2Bnetworks%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=_HE-olNHOAwJ&ei=ZsKgYZ6pCoiKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=880532151680791036&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:_HE-olNHOAwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Sequential+seeding+in+multilayer+networks&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.05335"}
