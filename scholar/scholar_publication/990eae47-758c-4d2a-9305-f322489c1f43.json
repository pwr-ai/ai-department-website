Adopting the probabilistic model of diagnostic problem the rule-based decision algorithm with learning is presented. Proposed algorithm was applied practically to the diagnosis of acute renal failure in children. Obtained results have proved its effectiveness in the computer medical decision-making.", "publisher": "IOS Press", "pages": "537--541", "booktitle": "Medical Informatics Europe\u201996", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "kurzynski1996rule"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/978-1-60750-878-6-537", "author_id": ["", "T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:5TquE02VVbwJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRule-Based%2BMedical%2BDecision%2BMaking%2Bvia%2BUnification%2BProcedure%2Bof%2BInformation%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=5TquE02VVbwJ&ei=qZagYY_PO4iKmgG4xKGQCA&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=13570917210426063589&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:5TquE02VVbwJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Rule-Based+Medical+Decision+Making+via+Unification+Procedure+of+Information&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://ebooks.iospress.nl/pdf/doi/10.3233/978-1-60750-878-6-537"}
