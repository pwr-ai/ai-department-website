Information acquired from the inter-lingual relations between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet and the relations between Princeton WordNet and SUMO ontology are used in the proposed rules. Several mapping rules together with the matching examples are presented. The automated mapping results were evaluated in two steps,(i) we automatically", "pages": "4351--4358", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'14)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kkedzia2014ruled"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://aclanthology.org/L14-1678/", "author_id": ["", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:MjeFir3KeeIJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRuled-based,%2Binterlingual%2Bmotivated%2Bmapping%2Bof%2Bplwordnet%2Bonto%2Bsumo%2Bontology%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=MjeFir3KeeIJ&ei=ibGgYbGLAYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 14, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=16319297640175318834&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:MjeFir3KeeIJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Ruled-based,+interlingual+motivated+mapping+of+plwordnet+onto+sumo+ontology&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://aclanthology.org/L14-1678/"}
