A new Iterative Multi-label Propagation (IMP) algorithm for relational learning in multi-label data is proposed. Based on the information of the already categorized videos and their relations to other videos, the system assigns suitable categories\u2014multiple labels to the unknown videos. The MapReduce approach to the IMP algorithm described in the paper enables processing of large datasets in parallel computing.
