We have embarked on a project in which this proportion increases to a lexically more realistic 1/3. The development of plWordNet 2.0 has been geared toward building up the verb hierarchy very considerably. The scaffolding upon which this part of our wordnet will rest is a detailed system of semantic relations. The selection of relations is informed by the linguistic accounts of Polish lexical semantics, notably the derivational procedures.
