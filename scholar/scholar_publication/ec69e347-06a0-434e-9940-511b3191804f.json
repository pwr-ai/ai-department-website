The final objective of this process is a method version that is parameter-less. Based on the research results presented that far, the leading methods in the combinatorial optimization are Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA), Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) and Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm II (DSMGA-II). P3 was originally proposed as a parameter-less method, while LTGA and DSMGA-II in their original", "pages": "289--290", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference Companion", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "komarnicki2019parameter"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319619.3322080", "author_id": ["", "bmJw3Z0AAAAJ"], "num_citations": 7, "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:2dCtxnfsY1AJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DParameter-less,%2Bpopulation-sizing%2BDSMGA-II%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&json=&update_op=library_add&info=2dCtxnfsY1AJ&ei=QEReYc7sD4fBmQGX-6OoBg", "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=5792733544907133145&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:2dCtxnfsY1AJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Parameter-less,+population-sizing+DSMGA-II&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
