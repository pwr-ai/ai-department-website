 abstract = {Identifying key persons active in social groups in the blogosphere is performed by means of social network analysis. Two main independent approaches are considered in the paper:(i) discovery of the most important individuals in persistent social communities and (ii) regular centrality measures applied either to social groups or the entire network. A new method for separating of groups stable over time, fulfilling given conditions of activity level of their members is proposed. Furthermore, a new concept for extracting user roles and key persons},
