Linguists and computational linguists rely on intuition or build lists of MWE types; while practical, that is scientifically and aesthetically unsatisfying. Without presuming to solve a daunting theoretical problem, we propose a decision procedure which steers a lexicographer toward acceptance or rejection of an N-gram as a lexical unit: a decision tree classifies N-grams as MWE or not MWE. It will succeed if it agrees with the native speakers' judgment.
