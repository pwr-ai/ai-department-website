It is based on the assumption that all relation extraction methods express some error, so we cannot identify the exact place (synset) for a new lemma on their bases, but an area (a wordnet subgraph). Support for a particular attachment point generated by knowledge should be expanded on the surrounding synsets. Moreover, the wordnet structure is modelled on the level of links", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "23--31", "booktitle": "International Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Methodology, Systems, and Applications", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2012lexical"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-33185-5_3", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "", "Sv_zNIgAAAAJ", "pulMdOUAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:HNeg_j8cEZEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLexical%2Bactivation%2Barea%2Battachment%2Balgorithm%2Bfor%2Bwordnet%2Bexpansion%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=HNeg_j8cEZEJ&ei=Ko6gYZ2mK-mGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10453167271284102940&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:HNeg_j8cEZEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Lexical+activation+area+attachment+algorithm+for+wordnet+expansion&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
