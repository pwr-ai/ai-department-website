Construction of such a parser is difficult in the case of inflective languages with relaxed word order like Polish. The goal of the work presented here is to analyse the extent of knowledge that can be expressed in the form of morphosyntactic constraints referring to morphological properties of word forms, and its applications in the automatic extraction of syntactic and", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "163--190", "booktitle": "Aspects of Natural Language Processing", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "piasecki2009morphosyntactic"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-04735-0_7", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:2Yhrx9-qJiEJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMorphosyntactic%2BConstraints%2Bin%2Bthe%2BAcquisition%2Bof%2BLinguistic%2BKnowledge%2Bfor%2BPolish%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=2Yhrx9-qJiEJ&ei=l7KgYeOQIoGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2388784530466769113&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:2Yhrx9-qJiEJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Morphosyntactic+Constraints+in+the+Acquisition+of+Linguistic+Knowledge+for+Polish&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
