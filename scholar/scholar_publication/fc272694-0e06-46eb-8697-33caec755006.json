We use data from Wikipedia, the prime example of community-run site, as our object of study. We define the quality as a distribution of user-assigned grades across a predefined range of possible scores and present a measure of distribution similarity to quantify the accuracy of a prediction. The proposed method of quality prediction is based on Markov Random Field and its Loopy", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "782--791", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kleminski2017quality"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-54472-4_73", "author_id": ["9A-CgPgAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "mk68epwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:g_LGd0k8BiMJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DOn%2BQuality%2BAssesement%2Bin%2BWikipedia%2BArticles%2BBased%2Bon%2BMarkov%2BRandom%2BFields%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=g_LGd0k8BiMJ&ei=86CgYbnwIYGEmgGSwISoAw&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2523770927427547779&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:g_LGd0k8BiMJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=On+Quality+Assesement+in+Wikipedia+Articles+Based+on+Markov+Random+Fields&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
