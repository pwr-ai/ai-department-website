The form recognition is decomposed into three levels: character recognition, word recognition and form contents recognition. On the word and form contents level the probabilistic lexicons are available. The decision on the word level is performed using probabilistic properties of character classifier and the contents of probabilistic lexicon. The novel approach to combining these two sources of information about classes (words)", "publisher": "Springer", "pages": "723--730", "booktitle": "Computer Recognition Systems", "pub_type": "incollection", "bib_id": "sas2005multilevel"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-32390-2_85", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:VKluxx_0ZccJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DMultilevel%2BRecognition%2Bof%2BStructured%2BHandprinted%2BDocuments-Probabilistic%2BApproach%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=VKluxx_0ZccJ&ei=0bCgYdTQBLGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=14368158603522517332&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:VKluxx_0ZccJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Multilevel+Recognition+of+Structured+Handprinted+Documents-Probabilistic+Approach&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
