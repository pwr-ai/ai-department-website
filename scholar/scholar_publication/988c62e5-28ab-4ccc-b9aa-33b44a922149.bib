 abstract = {We present a method for the structural collocation extraction for an inflective language (Polish) based on the process divided into two phases: 1. extraction and filtering of the pairs of lemmatised wordforms and 2. structural annotation of the extracted collocations with lexico-syntactic patterns. The pattern templates and parameters are specified manually but their instances are both generated and tested on the corpus automatically. The extracted collocations were evaluated by applying them as rules in morphosyntactic disambiguation of},
