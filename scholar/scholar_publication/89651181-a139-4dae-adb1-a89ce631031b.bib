 abstract = {In the paper the method of handprinted word recognition is described, which combines statistical lexical language model and character classifier properties in order to improve the recognition accuracy. The statistical lexical model determines the conditional probabilities of letters succession in the language. For some letters in polish language only very small subset of successors appears with significant conditional probability. If the confidence of predecessor recognition is assessed as high then the recognition of successor can be},
