 abstract = {The paper presents the supermatrix system, which was designed as a general tool supporting automatic acquisition of lexical semantic relations from corpora. The construction of the system is discussed, but also examples of different applications showing the potential of supermatrix are given. The core of the system is construction of co-incidence matrices from corpora written in any natural language as the system works on UTF-8 encoding and possesses modular construction. Supermatrix follows the general scheme of distributional},
