We discuss to what extent the recall of NE recognition can be improved by reducing the space of NE categories. We also present several extensions to the binary model which give an improvement of the recall. The extensions include: new features, application of external knowledge and post-processing. For the partial evaluation the final model obtained 90.02% recall with 91.30% precision on the corpus of economic news.", "pages": "94--99", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 4th Biennial International Workshop on Balto-Slavic Natural Language Processing", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "marcinczuk2013recognition"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-2414.pdf", "author_id": ["aAk1SIsAAAAJ", "pmQHb5IAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:U0NHOj9LWo0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRecognition%2Bof%2Bnamed%2Bentities%2Bboundaries%2Bin%2BPolish%2Btexts%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=U0NHOj9LWo0J&ei=X6mgYaG9DrGUy9YPieuc-As&json=", "num_citations": 8, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10185536242184569683&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:U0NHOj9LWo0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Recognition+of+named+entities+boundaries+in+Polish+texts&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-2414.pdf"}
