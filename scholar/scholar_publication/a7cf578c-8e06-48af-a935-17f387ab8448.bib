 abstract = {The paper starts with a short overview on areas of application for user profiles. Subsequently a method to represent user profile in the field of document retrieval by using query terms and weighted terms of retrieved documents is defined. The method is based on evaluating the pertinence of retrieved documents by the user. The created subprofiles are used to express the translation between terminology used by user and terminology accepted in some field of knowledge. Finally, the preliminary experiments are discussed.},
