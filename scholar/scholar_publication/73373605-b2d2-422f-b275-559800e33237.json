    "abstract": "In the paper a method of optimal selection of utterances used as command entry-words for voice controlled application is presented. Voice controlled programs seem to be particularly useful in the area of medical informatics, where a physician interacts with a program by voice while operating the medical device or being involved in examinations requiring manual activities. The proposed method selects command words from sets of proposals defined for each command so as to minimize the overall probability of incorrect command",
