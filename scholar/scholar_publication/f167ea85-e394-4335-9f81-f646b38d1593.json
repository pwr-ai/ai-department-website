The applied approach intuitively mimics a human way of recognition that relies on merging already found connectors into more complex ones. This procedure is modeled by our method where simple and obvious connectors and gradually extended to more complex structures. Each iteration may lead to modification of connectors set obtained so far. The modifications are managed by a rules set describing logical and graphical constraints", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "215--224", "booktitle": "2015 Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS)", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "sas2015logical"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7321444/", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", "A3zYitkAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:p6TKuNsXQf8J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLogical%2Bstructure%2Brecognition%2Bof%2Bdiagram%2Bimages%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=p6TKuNsXQf8J&ei=zJ6gYcvII4bQmAGRkJGIAg&json=", "num_citations": 2, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=18393008585623381159&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:p6TKuNsXQf8J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Logical+structure+recognition+of+diagram+images&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://annals-csis.org/proceedings/2015/pliks/383.pdf"}
