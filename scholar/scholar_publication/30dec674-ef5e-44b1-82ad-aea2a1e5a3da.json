Our method consists of a novel approach to generating unigram, bigram and trigram lexicons. The proposed method, called frequentiment, is based on calculating the frequency of features (words) in the document and averaging their impact on the sentiment score as opposed to documents that do not contain these features", "publisher": "Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute", "pages": "4", "number": "1", "volume": "18", "journal": "Entropy", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "augustyniak2016comprehensive"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/122560", "author_id": ["o3apDSYAAAAJ", "K8v7ROIAAAAJ", "GOoaHHEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:tve6q6sCRRsJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DComprehensive%2Bstudy%2Bon%2Blexicon-based%2Bensemble%2Bclassification%2Bsentiment%2Banalysis%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=tve6q6sCRRsJ&ei=3MigYb3FOeaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 34, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=1964979748760909750&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:tve6q6sCRRsJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Comprehensive+study+on+lexicon-based+ensemble+classification+sentiment+analysis&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/18/1/4/pdf"}
