 abstract = {The main goal of the paper is to propose a classification method for differential diagnosis in primary care domain. Commonly, the final diagnosis for the episode of care is related with the initial reason for encounter (RfE). However, many distinct diagnoses can follow from a single RfE and they need to be distinguished. The new method exploits the data about whole episodes of care quantified by individual patients' encounters and it extracts episode features from electronic health record to learn the classifier.
