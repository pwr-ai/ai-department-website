 abstract = {In the paper the problem of language modeling for automatic speech recognition in loose word order languages is considered. In loose word order languages classical n-gram language models are less effective, because the ordered word sequences encountered in the language corpus used to build the language models are less specific than in the case of strict word order languages. Because a word set appearing in the phrase is likely to appear in other permutation, all permutations of word sequences encountered in the corpus should},
