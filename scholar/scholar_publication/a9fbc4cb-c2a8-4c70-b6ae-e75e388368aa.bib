 abstract = {We present experiments with a variety of corpus-based measures applied to the problem of constructing semantic similarity functions for Polish nouns. Rich inflection in Polish allows us to acquire useful syntactic features without parsing; morphosyntactic restrictions checked in a large enough window provide sufficiently useful data. A novel feature selection method gives the accuracy of 86% on the WordNet-based synonymy test, an improvement of 5% over the previous results.},
