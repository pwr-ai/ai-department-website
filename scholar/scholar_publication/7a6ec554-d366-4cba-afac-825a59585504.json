We do not assume that the extracted relation instances (ie word pairs) are described by probabilities. Thus, results produced by any method, including pattern-based and Distributional Semantics approaches can be used. The algorithm is based on a general spreading activation model. Support for word-to-word semantic associations is first mapped on the existing wordnet structure.
