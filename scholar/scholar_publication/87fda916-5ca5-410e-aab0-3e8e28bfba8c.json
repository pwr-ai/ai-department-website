The aim of the tools is to make it easy to start experimenting with automatic speech recognition using Python and neural networks libraries. To make initial experiments even easier, apart from the programs that convert any acoustic corpus to the binary shape, also the ready to use datasets for speech recognition experiments in Polish are provided and described here.
