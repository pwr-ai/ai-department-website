    "abstract": "This paper presents a method that took second place in the GECCO 2020 Competition on Niching Methods for Multimodal Optimization. The method draws concepts from combinatorial multi\u2013objective optimization, but also adds new mechanisms specific for continuous spaces and multi\u2013modal aspects of the problem. GAP Selection operator is used to keep a high diversity of the population. A clustering mechanism identifies promising areas of the space, that are later optimized with a local search algorithm.
