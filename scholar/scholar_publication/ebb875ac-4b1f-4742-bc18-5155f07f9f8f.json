Our research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub 2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot's steering settings using the data acquired from the robot's sensors", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "107602", "journal": "Applied Soft Computing", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "zielinski20213d"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494621005238", "author_id": ["aISibuAAAAAJ", "A3zYitkAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Adlr_vCZ1T0J:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3D3D%2Brobotic%2Bnavigation%2Busing%2Ba%2Bvision-based%2Bdeep%2Breinforcement%2Blearning%2Bmodel%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=Adlr_vCZ1T0J&ei=yMqgYc2uPMySy9YP_K2EwAs&json=", "num_citations": 0, "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Adlr_vCZ1T0J:scholar.google.com/&scioq=3D+robotic+navigation+using+a+vision-based+deep+reinforcement+learning+model&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
