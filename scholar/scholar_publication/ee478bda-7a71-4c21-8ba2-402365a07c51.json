Their extraction, dynamics and evolution. One year ago the method for group evolution discovery (GED) was introduced. The GED method during extraction process takes into account both the group members quality and quantity. The quality is reflected by user importance measure. In this paper the influence of different user importance measures on the results of the GED method is examined and presented. The results indicate that using global", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.1534", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "saganowski2013influence"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1534", "author_id": ["DVE_klAAAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:DA1vdZVIDLAJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DInfluence%2Bof%2Bthe%2Buser%2Bimportance%2Bmeasure%2Bon%2Bthe%2Bgroup%2Bevolution%2Bdiscovery%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,44&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=DA1vdZVIDLAJ&ei=V6qgYaKQLYGUy9YP_b6g0Ag&json=", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=12685594057153383692&as_sdt=5,44&sciodt=0,44&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:DA1vdZVIDLAJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Influence+of+the+user+importance+measure+on+the+group+evolution+discovery&hl=en&as_sdt=0,44", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.1534"}
