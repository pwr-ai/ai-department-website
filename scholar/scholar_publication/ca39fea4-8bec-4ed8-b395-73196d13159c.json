    "abstract": "The paper presents a method of splitting patent drawings into subimages. For the image based patent retrieval and automatic document understanding it is required to use the individual subimages that are referenced in the text of a patent document. Our method utilizes the fact that subimages have their individual captions inscribed into the compound image. To find the approximate positions of subimages, first the specific captions are localized. Then subimages are found using the empirical rules concerning the relative",
