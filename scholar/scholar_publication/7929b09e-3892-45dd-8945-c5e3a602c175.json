Selection of the appropriate model complexity affects significantly the accuracy of speech recognition. For this reason the selection of the appropriate complexity level is crucial for practical speech recognition applications, where end user effort related to the implementation of speech recognition system is important. We investigated the correlation between speech recognition accuracy and two popular", "volume": "17", "journal": "Journal of Medical Informatics \\& Technologies", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "sas2011optimal"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0016-0012", "author_id": ["T1U6rMcAAAAJ", ""], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:hKC8ha4aBWoJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DOptimal%2Bacoustic%2Bmodel%2Bcomplexity%2Bselection%2Bin%2Bpolish%2Bmedical%2Bspeech%2Brecognition%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=hKC8ha4aBWoJ&ei=d86gYe2sG-aTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7639541679774277764&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:hKC8ha4aBWoJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Optimal+acoustic+model+complexity+selection+in+polish+medical+speech+recognition&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-article-PWA4-0016-0012/c/2011_v17_Sas.pdf"}
