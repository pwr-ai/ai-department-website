 abstract = {This article investigates the possibility of accurate quality prediction of resources generated by communities based on the crowd-generated content. We use data from Wikipedia, the prime example of community-run site, as our object of study. We define the quality as a distribution of user-assigned grades across a predefined range of possible scores and present a measure of distribution similarity to quantify the accuracy of a prediction. The proposed method of quality prediction is based on Markov Random Field and its Loopy},
