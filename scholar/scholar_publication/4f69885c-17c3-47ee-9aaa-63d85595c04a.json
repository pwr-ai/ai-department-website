First, the piece of music is divided into independent segments that potentially represent different emotional states. For this task the method of segmentation is used. The most important part is a features extraction from the music data. On this basis similar emotional parts are grouped by clustering algorithm. Music domain knowledge is used to extract features which are then grouped hierarchically by agglomerative clustering", "organization": "IEEE", "pages": "293--299", "booktitle": "2008 7th Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "bartoszewski2008extraction"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4557880/", "author_id": ["", "PGRjojAAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:odVZ27WogpQJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DExtraction%2Bof%2Bemotional%2Bcontent%2Bfrom%2Bmusic%2Bdata%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=odVZ27WogpQJ&ei=CsSgYazsNuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 6, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=10701301163608364449&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:odVZ27WogpQJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Extraction+of+emotional+content+from+music+data&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5"}
