Our contribution is twofold: we gathered a set of question\u2013answer pairs from various Polish sources and we performed an empirical evaluation of two re-ranking methods. The gathered collection contains factoid, list, non-factoid and yes-no questions, which makes a challenging material for experiments. We show that using two re-ranking methods based on term proximity allows to obtain significant improvement on simple information retrieval", "pages": "428--435", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the International Conference Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing RANLP 2013", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "marcinczuk2013evaluation"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R13-1056.pdf", "author_id": ["aAk1SIsAAAAJ", "", "nU_W9XwAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:oObqhcxCwigJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DEvaluation%2Bof%2Bbaseline%2Binformation%2Bretrieval%2Bfor%2Bpolish%2Bopen-domain%2Bquestion%2Banswering%2Bsystem%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=oObqhcxCwigJ&ei=EZagYZzOCOaTy9YP8feA4AQ&json=", "num_citations": 7, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=2936983353186510496&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:oObqhcxCwigJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Evaluation+of+baseline+information+retrieval+for+polish+open-domain+question+answering+system&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R13-1056.pdf"}
