    "abstract": "A model for data in multimedia systems is presented. It includes the notions of elementary and composed data, synchronisation points, stream, multimedia stream and beam (of multimedia streams). Some aspects and constrains of temporal composition are regarded. Operators for composition of beams are introduced and two kinds of composition are defined. A possible implementation of the model in SML is outlined. The model is also referred to the technical standard-MME. All notions are given their representation in RIFF",
