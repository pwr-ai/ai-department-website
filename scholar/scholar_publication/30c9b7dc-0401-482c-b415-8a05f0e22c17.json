Document type identification procedure utilizes fixed graphical elements of the forms on which documents are written. It is assumed that the form contains pre-printed frames consisting of distinct vertical and horizontal line segments. Line segments are detected using Hough transform. Next, the document image is rotated in order to make detected lines exactly vertical or horizontal.
