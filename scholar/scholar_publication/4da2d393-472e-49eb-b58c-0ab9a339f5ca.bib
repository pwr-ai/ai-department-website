 abstract = {To further extend the applicability of wearable sensors in various domains such as mobile health systems and the automotive industry, new methods for accurately extracting subtle physiological information from these wearable sensors are required. However, the extraction of valuable information from physiological signals is still challengingâ€”smartphones can count steps and compute heart rate, but they cannot recognize emotions and related affective states. This study analyzes the possibility of using end-to-end multimodal deep},
