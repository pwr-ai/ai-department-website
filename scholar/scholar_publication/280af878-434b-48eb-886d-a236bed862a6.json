    "abstract": "To analyze large social networks a lot of effort and resources are usually required. Network analysis offers many centrality measures that are successfully utilized in the process of investigating the social network characteristics. One of them is node position, which can be used to assess the importance of a given node within either the whole social network or the smaller subgroup. Three algorithms that can be utilized in the process of node position evaluation are presented in the paper: PIN edges, PIN nodes, and PIN hybrid. Also, different",
