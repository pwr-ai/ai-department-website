As it was previously presented by authors, classification of single element in output structure can be performed by generalization of input attributes as well as already partially classified output elements [9]. The paper addresses crucial problem of how to order elements in the structured learning process to get greater final accuracy. The learning is performed by means of ensemble, boosting classification method", "organization": "Springer", "pages": "301--309", "booktitle": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "kajdanowicz2012learning"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-28487-8_31", "author_id": ["GOoaHHEAAAAJ", "cxLgNccAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:6Kf9_7XgMWkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DLearning%2Band%2Binference%2Border%2Bin%2Bstructured%2Boutput%2Belements%2Bclassification%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=6Kf9_7XgMWkJ&ei=SqCgYc_RGuPUsQKZ27PQDg&json=", "num_citations": 1, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=7580086720129771496&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:6Kf9_7XgMWkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Learning+and+inference+order+in+structured+output+elements+classification&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://www.ii.pwr.edu.pl/~kajdanowicz/pubs/Kajdanowicz_2012_Learning%20and%20Inference%20Order%20in%20Structured%20Output%20Elements%20Classification.pdf"}
