The proposals in this research model of collaborative learning in an organizational social network are based on knowledge resource distribution through the establishment of a knowledge flow. The nodes, which represent knowledge workers, contain information about workers' social and cognitive abilities", "publisher": "Elsevier", "pages": "1248--1260", "volume": "51", "journal": "Computers in Human Behavior", "pub_type": "article", "bib_id": "rozewski2015knowledge"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214007298", "author_id": ["wGrDRVoAAAAJ", "xZJ38c4AAAAJ", "T7v65jEAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:AMQzzySk7DgJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DKnowledge%2Bworkers%25E2%2580%2599%2Bcollaborative%2Blearning%2Bbehavior%2Bmodeling%2Bin%2Ban%2Borganizational%2Bsocial%2Bnetwork%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=AMQzzySk7DgJ&ei=C5SgYZWfIOmGy9YPjOe62AU&json=", "num_citations": 41, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=4101833838629733376&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:AMQzzySk7DgJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Knowledge+workers%E2%80%99+collaborative+learning+behavior+modeling+in+an+organizational+social+network&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03055"}
