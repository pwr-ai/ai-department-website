It was built on the basis of machine learning in a way following the bootstrapping approach: a limited set of derivational pairs described manually by linguists in plWordNet is used to train Derivator. The tool is intended to be applied in semi-automated expansion of plWordNet with new instances of derivational relations. The training process is based on the construction of two transducers working in the opposite directions: one for", "pages": "916--922", "booktitle": "LREC", "pub_type": "inproceedings", "bib_id": "piasecki2012recognition"}, "filled": true, "gsrank": 1, "pub_url": "http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/926_Paper.pdf", "author_id": ["nU_W9XwAAAAJ", "Sv_zNIgAAAAJ", "hc3Zj7UAAAAJ"], "url_scholarbib": "/scholar?q=info:Wizg752QGfkJ:scholar.google.com/&output=cite&scirp=0&hl=en", "url_add_sclib": "/citations?hl=en&xsrf=&continue=/scholar%3Fq%3DRecognition%2Bof%2BPolish%2BDerivational%2BRelations%2BBased%2Bon%2BSupervised%2BLearning%2BScheme.%26hl%3Den%26as_sdt%3D0,5&citilm=1&update_op=library_add&info=Wizg752QGfkJ&ei=tLKgYYRHsZTL1g-J65z4Cw&json=", "num_citations": 16, "citedby_url": "/scholar?cites=17949536797870533722&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?q=related:Wizg752QGfkJ:scholar.google.com/&scioq=Recognition+of+Polish+Derivational+Relations+Based+on+Supervised+Learning+Scheme.&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5", "eprint_url": "http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/926_Paper.pdf"}
