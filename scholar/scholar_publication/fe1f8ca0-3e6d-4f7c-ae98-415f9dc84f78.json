    "abstract": "In relational learning tasks such as within network classification the main problem arises from the inference of nodes' labels based on the the ground true labels of remaining nodes. The problem becomes even harder if the nodes from initial network do not have any labels assigned and they have to be acquired. However, labels of which nodes should be obtained in order to provide fair classification results? Active learning and inference is a practical framework to study this problem. The method for active learning and inference in within",
