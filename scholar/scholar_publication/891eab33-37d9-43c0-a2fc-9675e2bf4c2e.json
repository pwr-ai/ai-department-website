    "abstract": "In this paper, two level handwriting recognition concept is presented, where writer identification is used in order to increase handwriting recognition accuracy. On the upper level, author identification is performed. Lower level consists of a classifiers set trained on samples coming from individual writers. Recognition from upper level is used on the lower level for selecting or combining classifiers trained for identified writers. The feature set used on the upper level contains directional features as well as the features characteristic for",
