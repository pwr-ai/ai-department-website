I am an early-stage researcher working on problems related to information diffusion in multilayer networks, such as the spread of misinformation, the dynamics of epidemic outbreaks, and the identification of key influencers in social systems. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing strategies to mitigate societal risks, enhance public health responses, and improve communication in interconnected environments. My industrial expertise encompasses challenges in computer vision, cybersecurity, and the optimisation of industrial processes, including the deployment of ML-based solutions in production environments.
