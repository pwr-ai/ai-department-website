Piotr is a passionate programmer and machine learning enthusiast. He started his research in ML while working at Intel on reinforcement learning methods for large scale cluster schedulers. The work was then continued during his Bachelor thesis (RL-based Linux process scheduler). Later, during Masters studies, he explored the area of representation learning on graphs. His Master thesis “Incremental learning techniques for embedding of temporal graphs” won the first prize in the national competition for the “Best Master thesis in Computer Science”. Currently, he focuses on unsupervised representation learning methods for attributed graphs.
