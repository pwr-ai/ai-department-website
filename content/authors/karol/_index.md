Coming from a life-long passion for medicine, Michał Karol is involved in research in the field of digital pathology.
Currently, he is focused on developing software for histopathological image generation using cutting-edge methods in machine learning. 
This work is a continuation of his master thesis which was written under the supervision of the Ph.D. Martin Tabakow.   
His work combines skills acquired through an interest in photography as well as deep-rooted enthusiasm for computer science.

In his private life, he participated as a frontend developer in open-source projects for Polish NGOs. He stays up to date with the hottest programming topics by reading Reddit and HackerNews. As his Spotify Wrapped report says, he listens to music a lot, like 1/3 of a year in a minutes lot.
