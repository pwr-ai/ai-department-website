Paweł Narolski is an AI Engineer and PhD Candidate at Wrocław University of Science and Technology, where his research focuses on the intersection of computer vision, representation learning, and the security of biometric systems. He is currently advised by Prof. Marek Klonowski within the Department of Artificial Intelligence.

His work is driven by the challenge of deploying robust AI in high-stakes, mission-critical environments. Specifically, he investigates Face Morphing biometric attack detection to ensure the integrity of digital identity, as well as leveraging VLLMs in public security. His research aims to establish new benchmarks for reliability in AI systems, balancing algorithmic performance with the rigorous demands of real-world applications.

A member of the European Association of Biometrics (EAB), Paweł brings a unique industrial perspective to academia, having led the research and development of ISO/IEC compliant presentation (PAD) and injection attack detection (IAD) systems. Before his doctoral studies, he developed highly scalable, real-time backend systems for global customer service platform, conducted foundational research in deep language modelling (BSc, 2020), and worked on data sketch set theory operation estimators for LPR systems, for which he received his MSc (2021) from WUST.
