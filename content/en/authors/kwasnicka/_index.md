Prof. dr hab. inż. Halina Kwaśnicka is a Full Professor in the Institute of Informatics, the Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Wroclaw University of Technology, Poland.
She has graduated from the Faculty of Electronics at the Wrocław University of Technology. She received PhD and DSc (habilitation in Poland) at the Faculty of Electronics. In 2009 she won the professor's academic title, the procedure was conducted by the System Research Institute Polish Academy of Sciences. She is a full professor of Computer Science, head of the Department of Computational Intelligence (up to the end of 2020). In 2016 -- 2020 she was Head of Doctoral Studies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Management of the Wroclaw University of Technology. For many years she was the deputy director for research of the Institute of Computer Science in this Faculty. Her research interests have evolved from nature-inspired methods, through knowledge-based systems to machine learning and image interpretation. Last exiting subject is Object Hierarchy Generation (https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1cKzg4ZQE1auj).
She is the author of over 200 scientific papers, five books, co-editor of two books (Springer). She gave several invited lectures. She is a patron of created in 2018 specialization Data Science (master study). She managed research projects on the application of artificial intelligence methods in medicine, image analysis. She is active in international cooperation - she has participated in EU projects and managed the Polish-Singaporean research project. At the invitation of the then Ministry of Digitization, as part of the AI-Tech project consortium, she began to create, together with the members of the Department of Computational Intelligence, a new master's degree course: Artificial Intelligence. It will be launched in February 2021. She is a member of the Program Council of this project.
