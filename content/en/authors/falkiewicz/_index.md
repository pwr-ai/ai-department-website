A mathematician who wanted to become a Data Scientist. After research in Information Diffusion and Social Networks during my Bachelor studies, I have turned into Representation Learning, especially Network Embedding.
Currently, my primary research is on Geometric Deep Learning and application of non-Euclidean geometry. However, my interests are much broader than that, but they have one thing in common - bringing the right theory where it is needed.
