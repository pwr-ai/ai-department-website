He is a PhD student at Department of Computational Intelligence, a computer scientists at
[CLARIN-PL](http://clarin-pl.eu) project, and a member of the [Emognition](https://emotions.pwr.edu.pl) research
group. His research is concentrated on end-to-end deep learning solutions
for emotion recognition from physiological and behavioural signals. At the beginning of his PhD he was
researching the effectiveness of polish and european science which resulted in solutions which are being commercialized.
He has also almost 3 years of experience as a software engineer.
