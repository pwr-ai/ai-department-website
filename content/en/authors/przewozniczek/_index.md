Dr. Michal Witold Przewozniczek received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. (with honors) degrees in computer science
in 2003 and 2012, respectively, from Wroclaw University of Science and Technology (WUST), Poland. He is
an Assistant Professor with the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology in the Department of
Computational Intelligence. In 2019, while associated with WUST, he also worked as a researcher at the
Department of Computer Science, The University of York, England. Michal’s research concentrates on the
application of evolutionary algorithms to practical problems. To obtain this objective, he investigates the
linkage learning techniques, multi-population approaches, dynamic management of subpopulations, and
others. This experience helped in solving hard multi-objective industrial problems as a team member at
The University of York.
Michal frequently publishes scientific articles in world-leading journals and conferences (Core ranking A
and A*) in Evolutionary Computation. He is also a reviewer in leading journals concerning this field. Michal
has proposed and received funding for scientific projects for fundamental research in the field of
Evolutionary Computation, in which he acts as a Principal Investigator. He leads projects in cooperation
with commercial companies and is an inventor (also as a co-owner of a software company) of many
prototype systems implemented in the industry field in Poland and abroad.
In his private life, the great fun of volleyball, Pink Floyd, Dire Straits, and Iron Maiden. The former head of
the Wroclaw’s University of Science and Technology badminton team, the multi-medalist of Polish
Academic Championships, and a still-active sportsman.
