abstract: Human communication is commonly represented as a temporal social network,
  and evaluated in terms of its uniqueness. We propose a set of new entropy-based
  measures for human communication dynamics represented within the temporal social
  network as event sequences. Using real world datasets and random interaction series
  of different types we find that real human contact events always significantly differ
  from random ones. This human distinctiveness increases over time and by means of
  the proposed entropy measures, we
