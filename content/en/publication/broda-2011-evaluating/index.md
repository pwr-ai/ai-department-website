abstract: Abstrakty EN Word Sense Disambiguation in text remains a difficult problem
  as the best supervised methods require laborious and costly manual preparation of
  training data. On the other hand, the unsupervised methods yield significantly lower
  precision and produce results that are not satisfying for many applications. Recently,
  an algorithm based on weakly-supervised learning for WSD called Lexicographer-Controlled
  Semi-automatic Sense Disambiguation (LexCSD) was proposed. The method is based on
  clustering of text snippets
