abstract: Diffusion of information and viral content, social contagion and influence
  are still topics of broad evaluation. As theory explaining the role of influentials
  moves slightly to reduce their importance in the propagation of viral content, authors
  of the following paper have studied the information epidemic in a social networking
  platform in order to confirm recent theoretical findings in this area. While most
  of related experiments focus on the level of individuals, the elementary entities
  of the following analysis are dyads. The authors study behavioral motifs
