abstract: In the paper we present an adaptation of the Espresso algorithm of the extraction
  of lexical semantic relation to specific requirements of Polish. The introduced
  changes are of more technical character like the adaptation to the existing Polish
  language tools, but also we investigate the structure of the patterns that takes
  into account specific features of Polish as an inflectional language. A new method
  of the reliability measure computation is proposed. The modified version of the
  algorithm called Estratto was compared with the more direct
publication: '*2008 International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information
  Technology*'
