abstract: The paper presents an open, web-based system for stylometric analysis named
  WebSty, which is a part of the CLARIN-PL research infrastructure. WebSty does not
  require local installation by users, can be used via any web browser, offers rich
  set-up, and runs on a computing cluster. We discuss the underlying ideas of the
  system, its architecture, a pipeline of language tools for processing Polish, and
  its integration with systems for clustering, visualizing the results of clustering,
  and identifying the features of the strongest
