abstract: Node classification in Social Network is currently receiving raising attention
  in the Social Network Analysis research. The main objective of node classification
  is to assign the correct label to the unlabeled nodes from a set of all possible
  class labels. This classification task is performed using features extracted from
  a Social Network dataset. The success of proper feature extraction significantly
  influences classification accuracy, providing more discriminative description of
  the data. This paper describes label-dependent features
