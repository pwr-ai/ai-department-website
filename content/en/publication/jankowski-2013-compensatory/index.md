abstract: Diffusion of information in social networks takes more and more attention
  from marketers. New methods and algorithms are constantly developed towards maximizing
  reach of the campaigns and increasing their effectiveness. One of the important
  research directions in this area is related to selecting initial nodes of the campaign
  to result with maximizing its effects represented as total number of infections.
  To achieve this goal, several strategies were developed and they are based on different
  network measures and other characteristics
