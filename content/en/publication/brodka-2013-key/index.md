abstract: The number of systems that collect vast amount of data about users rapidly
  grow during last few years. Many of these systems contain data not only about people
  characteristics but also about their relationships with other system users. From
  this kind of data it is possible to extract a social network that reflects the connections
  between system's users. Moreover, the analysis of such social network enables to
  investigate different characteristics of its members and their linkages. One of
  the types of examining such network is key users extraction. Key
