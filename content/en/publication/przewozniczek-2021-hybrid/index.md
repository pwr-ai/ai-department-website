abstract: Linkage learning techniques are employed to discover dependencies between
  problem variables. This knowledge can then be leveraged in an Evolutionary Algorithm
  (EA) to improve the optimization process. Of particular interest is the Gene-pool
  Optimal Mixing Evolutionary Algorithm (GOMEA) family, which has been shown to exploit
  linkage effectively. Recently, Empirical Linkage Learning (ELL) techniques were
  proposed for binary-encoded problems. While these techniques are computationally
  expensive, they have the benefit of
