abstract: The paper presents an approach to tagging of Polish based on the combination
  of handmade reduction rules and selecting rules acquired by Induction of Decision
  Trees. The general open architecture of the tagger is presented, where the overall
  process of tagging is divided into subsequent steps and the overall problem is reduced
  to subproblems of ambiguity classes. A special language of constraints and the use
  of constraints as elements of decision trees are described. The results of the experiments
  performed with the tagger are
