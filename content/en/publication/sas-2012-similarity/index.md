abstract: In the paper we consider the problem of continuous handwriting segmentation
  into individual characters. The ultimate aim is to create the set of isolated character
  images used as a training set for the writer-dependent handwriting recognizer. Analytic
  approach is applied, where word recognition is based on the individual classification
  of characters. The input to the proposed segmentation method is a handwritten text
  image consisting of known words. The method consists of three stages. Initially,
  images of isolated words are over
