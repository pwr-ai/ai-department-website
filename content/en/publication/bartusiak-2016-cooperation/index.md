abstract: In order to solve link prediction problem with higher accuracy than achieved
  by classical supervised approaches we provide a proposal of the method based on
  information extracted from network using pre-processing done by Restricted Boltzmann
  Machine (RBM) and statistical inference models. Input space is fed to RBM in order
  to provide new sparse coded feature space that is used in order to estimate parameters
  of classical inference models. By accomplishing link prediction with proposed RBM
  pre-processing noticeable increase of all
