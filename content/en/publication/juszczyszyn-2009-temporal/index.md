abstract: The dynamics of complex social networks has become one of the research areas
  of growing importance. The knowledge about temporal changes of the network topology
  and characteristics is crucial in networked communication systems in which accurate
  predictions are important. The local network topology can be described by the means
  of network motifs which are small subgraphs--usually containing from 3 to 7 nodes.
  They were shown to be useful for creating profiles that reveal several properties
  of the network. In this paper, the
