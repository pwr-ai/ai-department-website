abstract: 'We present a new approach to stratifying multi-label data for classification
  purposes based on the iterative stratification approach proposed by Sechidis et.
  al. in an ECML PKDD 2011 paper. Our method extends the iterative approach to take
  into account second-order relationships between labels. Obtained results are evaluated
  using statistical properties of obtained strata as presented by Sechidis. We also
  propose new statistical measures relevant to second-order quality: label pairs distribution,
  the percentage of label pairs'
