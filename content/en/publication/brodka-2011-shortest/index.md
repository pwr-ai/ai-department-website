abstract: Multi-layered social networks consist of the fixed set of nodes linked by
  multiple connections. These connections may be derived from different types of user
  activities logged in the IT system. To calculate any structural measures for multi-layered
  networks this multitude of relations should be coped with in the parameterized way.
  Two separate algorithms for evaluation of shortest paths in the multi-layered social
  network are proposed in the paper. The first one is based on pre-processing-aggregation
  of multiple links into single multi
