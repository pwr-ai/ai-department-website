abstract: Social network analysis offers many measures, which are successfully utilized
  to describe the social network profile. One of them is node position, useful to
  assess the importance of a given node within both the whole network and its smaller
  subgroups. However, to analyze large social networks a lot of effort and resources
  are necessary. In this paper, some algorithms that can be utilized in the process
  of node position evaluation are presented and their efficiency is tested. In particular,
  three distinct algorithms were developed and
