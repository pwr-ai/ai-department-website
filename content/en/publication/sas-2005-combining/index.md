abstract: In the paper, the method of combining character classifiers for handprinted
  text recognition is presented. The combination rule is based on member classifiers
  reliability assessment. The assessment can be based on probabilistic classifier
  properties or it can use similarity measures individually evaluated for the character
  currently being recognized. The approach presented here follows soft classification
  paradigm, where the classifier not merely selects single class, but it provides
  the vector of support values corresponding to character
