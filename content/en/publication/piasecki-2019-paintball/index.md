abstract: plWordNet has been consequently built on the basis of the corpus-based wordnet
  development method. As plWordNet construction had started from scratch it was necessary
  to find a way to reduce the amount of work required, and not to reduce the quality.
  In the paper we discuss the gained experience in applying different tools based
  on Distributional Semantics methods to support the work of lexicographers. A special
  attention is given to the Paintball algorithm for semiautomated wordnet expansion
  and its application in the
publication: '*Computational Methods in Science and Technology*'
