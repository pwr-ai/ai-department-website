abstract: The study explores application of a simple Convolutional Neural Network
  for the problem of authorship attribution of tweets written in Polish. In our solution
  we use two-step compression of tweets using Byte Pair Encoding algorithm and vectorisation
  as an input to the distributional model generated for the large corpus of Polish
  tweets by word2vec algorithm. Our method achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art
  approaches for the similar task on English tweets and expresses a very good performance
  in the classification
