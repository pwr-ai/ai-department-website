abstract: Our objective is to provide a flexible, scalable, distributed architecture
  that assures a high performance for information extraction (IE) systems working
  in Internet. The architecture is based on both the general paradigm of the service-oriented
  architecture, client-server approach and strong separation of concerns between storage
  and processing components. An experimental IE system, named Semanta, utilising the
  proposed architecture is also presented. In the following document, we describe
  five main Semanta services, which are
