abstract: We present an approach to the description of Polish Multi-word Expressions
  (MWEs) which is based on expressions in the WCCL language of morpho-syntactic constraints
  instead of grammar rules or transducers. For each MWE its basic morphological form
  and the base forms of its constituents are specified but also each MWE is assigned
  to a class on the basis of its syntactic structure. For each class a WCCL constraint
  is defined which is parametrised by string variables referring to MWE constituent
  base forms or inflected forms. The constraint
