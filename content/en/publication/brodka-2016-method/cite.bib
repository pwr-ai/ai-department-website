 abstract = {The main subject studied in this dissertation is a multi-layered social network (MSN) and its analysis. One of the crucial problems in multi-layered social network analysis is community extraction. To cope with this problem the CLECC measure (Cross Layered Edge Clustering Coefficient) was proposed in the thesis. It is an edge measure which expresses how much the neighbors of two given users are similar each other. Based on this measure the CLECC algorithm for community extraction in the multi-layered social networks was designed. The},
