abstract: Wearables equipped with pervasive sensors enable us to monitor physiological
  and behavioral signals. In this study, we revised 55 off-the-shelf devices in recognition
  and analysis of emotion, stress, meditation, sleep, and physical activity, especially
  in field studies. Their usability directly comes from the types of sensors they
  possess as well as the quality and availability of raw signals. We found there is
  no versatile device suitable for all purposes. Empatica E4 and Microsoft Band 2
  are good at emotion, stress, and together with
