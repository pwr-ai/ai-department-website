abstract: Multi-label classification is a machine learning task that assumes that
  a data instance may be assigned with multiple number of class labels at the same
  time. Modelling of this problem has become an important research topic recently.
  This paper revokes AdaBoostSeq multi-label classification algorithm and examines
  it in order to check its robustness properties. It can be stated that AdaBoostSeq
  is able to result with quite stable Hamming Loss evaluation measure regardless of
  the size of input and output space.
