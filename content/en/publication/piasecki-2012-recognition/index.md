abstract: 'The paper presents construction of Derywatorâ€“a language tool for the recognition
  of Polish derivational relations. It was built on the basis of machine learning
  in a way following the bootstrapping approach: a limited set of derivational pairs
  described manually by linguists in plWordNet is used to train Derivator. The tool
  is intended to be applied in semi-automated expansion of plWordNet with new instances
  of derivational relations. The training process is based on the construction of
  two transducers working in the opposite directions: one for'
