abstract: This paper presents the system for automatic emotion detection from music
  data stored in MIDI format files. First, the piece of music is divided into independent
  segments that potentially represent different emotional states. For this task the
  method of segmentation is used. The most important part is a features extraction
  from the music data. On this basis similar emotional parts are grouped by clustering
  algorithm. Music domain knowledge is used to extract features which are then grouped
  hierarchically by agglomerative clustering
