abstract: Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are well known
  optimization tools. PSO advantage is its capability for fast convergence to the
  promising solutions. On the other hand GAs are able to process schemata thanks to
  the use of crossover operator. However, both methods have also their drawbacks-PSO
  may fall into the trap of preconvergence, while GA capability of fast finding locally
  optimal (or close to optimal) solutions seems low when compared to PSO. Relatively
