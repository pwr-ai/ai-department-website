 abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are well known optimization tools. PSO advantage is its capability for fast convergence to the promising solutions. On the other hand GAs are able to process schemata thanks to the use of crossover operator. However, both methods have also their drawbacks-PSO may fall into the trap of preconvergence, while GA capability of fast finding locally optimal (or close to optimal) solutions seems low when compared to PSO. Relatively new, important research},
