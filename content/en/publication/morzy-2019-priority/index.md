abstract: We claim that networks are created according to the priority attachment
  mechanism. We introduce a simple model, which uses the priority attachment to generate
  both synthetic and close to empirical networks. Priority attachment is a mechanism,
  which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or
  preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world
  networks. In this paper, we show that by using priority attachment we can generate
  networks of very diverse topologies, as
