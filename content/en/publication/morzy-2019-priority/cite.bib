 abstract = {We claim that networks are created according to the priority attachment mechanism. We introduce a simple model, which uses the priority attachment to generate both synthetic and close to empirical networks. Priority attachment is a mechanism, which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world networks. In this paper, we show that by using priority attachment we can generate networks of very diverse topologies, as},
