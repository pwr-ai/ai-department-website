abstract: Due to the continuous growth of Internet traffic, new technologies are proposed
  to overcome the capacity crunch problem. One of the most promising solutions for
  optical backbone networks is space division multiplexing (SDM), which allows parallel
  transmissions in properly designed optical fibers. In SDM, the problem of routing,
  space, and spectrum allocation (RSSA) emerges. RSSA is more challenging than corresponding
  optimization problems in optical networks without spatial multiplexing since the
  additional spatial
