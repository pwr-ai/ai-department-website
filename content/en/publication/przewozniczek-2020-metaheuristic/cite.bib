 abstract = {Due to the continuous growth of Internet traffic, new technologies are proposed to overcome the capacity crunch problem. One of the most promising solutions for optical backbone networks is space division multiplexing (SDM), which allows parallel transmissions in properly designed optical fibers. In SDM, the problem of routing, space, and spectrum allocation (RSSA) emerges. RSSA is more challenging than corresponding optimization problems in optical networks without spatial multiplexing since the additional spatial},
