  the needs of forensic linguistics. Suicide notes are messages created in borderline
  situation, shortly before death. Hence the annotation schema requires a complex
  description of a document structure, the textual content, as well as its linguistic
  properties. TEI was selected as the basis for the document encoding schema. TEI
  adaptation and extension with respect to such aspects of encoding as: a letter structure,
  various layers of changes and omissions, error'
