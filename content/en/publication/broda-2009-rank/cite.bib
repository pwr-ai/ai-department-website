 abstract = {Rank weight functions had been shown to increase the accuracy of measures of semantic relatedness for Polish. We present a generalised ranking principle and demonstrate its effect on a range of established measures of semantic relatedness, and on a different language. The results confirm that the generalised transformation method based on ranking brings an improvement over several well-known measures.},
