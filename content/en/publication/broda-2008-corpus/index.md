abstract: The construction of a wordnet, a labour-intensive enterprise, can be significantly
  assisted by automatic grouping of lexical material and discovery of lexical semantic
  relations. The objective is to ensure high quality of automatically acquired results
  before they are presented for lexicographers' approval. We discuss a software tool
  that suggests synset members using a measure of semantic relatedness with a given
  verb or adjective; this extends previous work on nominal synsets in Polish WordNet.
  Syntactically-motivated
