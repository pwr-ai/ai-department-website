abstract: This document presents a method of a logical links structure recognition
  between elements on diagrams. The applied approach intuitively mimics a human way
  of recognition that relies on merging already found connectors into more complex
  ones. This procedure is modeled by our method where simple and obvious connectors
  and gradually extended to more complex structures. Each iteration may lead to modification
  of connectors set obtained so far. The modifications are managed by a rules set
  describing logical and graphical constraints
