abstract: The advancement of science, as outlined by Popper and Kuhn, is largely qualitative,
  but with bibliometric data, it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative
  picture of scientific progress. Furthermore, it is also important to allocate finite
  resources to research topics that have the growth potential to accelerate the process
  from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address
  this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analyzing the APS data sets
  from 1981 to 2010. We build the bibliographic
publication: '*Entropy*'
