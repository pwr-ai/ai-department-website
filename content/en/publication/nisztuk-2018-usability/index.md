abstract: This article is an overview focused on functionality and usability of selected
  contemporary approaches for the computational floor plan generation of architectural
  objects. This article describes current solutions for generative architectural design
  and focuses on their usability from the point of view of architectural design practice.
  Recent research papers and prototypes, as well as the most important tools (selected
  computer-aided design and BIM software) for generative design from the architectural
  perspective, are described. The
publication: '*International Journal of Architectural Computing*'
