abstract: The paper offers a critical evaluation of the power and usefulness of an
  automatic prompt system based on the extended Relaxation Labelling algorithm in
  the process of (manual) mapping plWordNet on Princeton WordNet. To this end the
  results of manual mapping–that is inter-lingual relations between plWN and PWN synsets–are
  juxtaposed with the automatic prompts that were generated for the source language
  synsets to be mapped. We check the number and type of inter-lingual relations introduced
  on the basis of automatic prompts and
