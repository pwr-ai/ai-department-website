abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems introduce word errors, which
  often confuse punctuation prediction models, turning punctuation restoration into
  a challenging task. These errors usually take the form of homonyms. We show how
  retrofitting of the word embeddings on the domain-specific data can mitigate ASR
  errors. Our main contribution is a method for better alignment of homonym embeddings
  and the validation of the presented method on the punctuation prediction task. We
  record the absolute improvement in
