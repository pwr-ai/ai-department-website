 abstract = {Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems introduce word errors, which often confuse punctuation prediction models, turning punctuation restoration into a challenging task. These errors usually take the form of homonyms. We show how retrofitting of the word embeddings on the domain-specific data can mitigate ASR errors. Our main contribution is a method for better alignment of homonym embeddings and the validation of the presented method on the punctuation prediction task. We record the absolute improvement in},
