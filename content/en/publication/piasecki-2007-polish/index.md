abstract: A large number of different tags, limited corpora and the free word order
  are the main causes of low accuracy of tagging in Polish (automatic disambiguation
  of morphological descriptions) by applying commonly used techniques based on stochastic
  modelling. In the paper the rule-based architecture of the TaKIPI Polish tagger
  combining handwritten and automatically extracted rules is presented. The possibilities
  of optimisation of its parameters and component are discussed, including the possibility
  of using different methods of rules
