 abstract = {A large number of different tags, limited corpora and the free word order are the main causes of low accuracy of tagging in Polish (automatic disambiguation of morphological descriptions) by applying commonly used techniques based on stochastic modelling. In the paper the rule-based architecture of the TaKIPI Polish tagger combining handwritten and automatically extracted rules is presented. The possibilities of optimisation of its parameters and component are discussed, including the possibility of using different methods of rules},
