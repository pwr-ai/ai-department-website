 abstract = {In recent years, many studies on urban mobility based on large data sets have been published: most of them are based on crowdsourced GPS data or smart-card data. We present, what is to the best of our knowledge, the first exploration of public transport delay data harvested from a large-scale, official public transport positioning system, provided by the Wrocław municipality. We introduce the methodology to analyze the distribution of delays in public transport, enabling the improvement of timetables by making them more},
