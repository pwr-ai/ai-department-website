abstract: Academia remains the central place of machine learning education. While
  academic culture is the predominant factor influencing the way we teach machine
  learning to students, many practitioners question this culture, claiming the lack
  of alignment between academic and business environments. Drawing on professional
  experiences from both sides of the chasm, we describe the main points of contention,
  in the hope that it will help better align academic syllabi with the expectations
  towards future machine learning practitioners. We also provide
publication: '*Foundations of Computing and Decision Sciences*'
