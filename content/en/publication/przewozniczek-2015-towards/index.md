abstract: The new promising technologies in the network communication field bring
  the possibilities of faster and more safe information sending. However, the new
  technologies bring up new computation problems as well. The network flow may be
  organized in a better way with respect to different criteria. It is common that
  such problems are hard not only because of their size, but also due to their NP-complete
  or NP-hard nature. The Genetic Algorithms are commonly known and widely used tools,
  which allow to effectively solve such problems. It is
