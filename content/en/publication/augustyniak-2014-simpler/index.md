abstract: It has been shown in this paper that simplistic Bag of Words (BoW) lexicon
  methods for sentiment polarity assignment with ensemble classifiers are much faster
  than a supervised approach to sentiment classification while yielding similar accuracy.
  BoW methods also proved to be efficient and fast across all examined datasets. Moreover,
  a new approach to lexicon extraction that can be successfully used for sentiment
  polarity assignment is presented in the paper. It has been shown that accuracy obtained
  from such lexicons
