abstract: 'We present Self-organising Logic of Structures (SLS), a semantic representation
  language of high expressive power, which was designed for a fully compositional
  representation of discourse anaphora following the Dynamic Semantics paradigm. The
  application of SLS to the description of possible meanings of Polish multiple quantifier
  sentences is discussed. Special attention is paid to the phenomena of: cardinality
  dependency/independency of Noun Phrase quantifiers and variety of quantification.
  Semantic representation based on'
