abstract: Analysis of encounter data relevant to the diagnostic process sourced from
  routine electronic medical record (EMR) databases represents a classic example of
  the concept of a learning healthcare system (LHS). By collecting International Classification
  of Primary Care (ICPC) coded EMR data as part of the Transition Project from Dutch
  and Maltese databases (using the EMR TransHIS), data mining algorithms can empirically
  quantify the relationships of all presenting reasons for encounter (RfEs) and recorded
  diagnostic outcomes. We have
