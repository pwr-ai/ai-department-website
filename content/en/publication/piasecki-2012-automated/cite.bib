 abstract = {We present a machine learning approach to the generation of derivative relations. Instances of derivative relations described in a wordnet are used in the bootstrapping approach to build an analyser of derivational relations. plWordNet derivational relations are presented and the planned semi-automatic wordnet expansion with derivational relations is discussed. Limits to which form-based markers can encode semantic distinctions are analysed and a model of semantic post-filtering of the generated derivational relation instances is presented.},
