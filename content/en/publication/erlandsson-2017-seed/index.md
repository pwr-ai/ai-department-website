abstract: Information spreading is an interesting field in the domain of online social
  media. In this work, we are investigating how well different seed selection strategies
  affect the spreading processes simulated using independent cascade model on eighteen
  multilayer social networks. Fifteen networks are built based on the user interaction
  data extracted from Facebook public pages and tree of them are multilayer networks
  downloaded from public repository (two of them being Twitter networks). The results
  indicate that various state of the
