abstract: The world of network science is fascinating and filled with complex phenomena
  that we aspire to understand. One of them is the dynamics of spreading processes
  over complex networked structures. Building the knowledge-base in the field where
  we can face more than one spreading process propagating over a network that has
  more than one layer is a challenging task, as the complexity comes both from the
  environment in which the spread happens and from characteristics and interplay of
  spreads' propagation. As this cross
