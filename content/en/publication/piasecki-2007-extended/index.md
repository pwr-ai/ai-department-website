abstract: We propose a more demanding version of a well-known WordNet-Based Similarity
  Test. Our work with semantic similarity functions for Polish nouns has shown that
  test to be insufficiently stringent. We briefly present the background, explain
  the extension of WBST and report on experiments that contrast the old and new evaluation
  tool.
