 abstract = {We propose a more demanding version of a well-known WordNet-Based Similarity Test. Our work with semantic similarity functions for Polish nouns has shown that test to be insufficiently stringent. We briefly present the background, explain the extension of WBST and report on experiments that contrast the old and new evaluation tool.},
