abstract: Sentiment analysis is a relatively new engineering problem in the domain
  of Natural Language Processing. Its crucial tool are sentiment polarities assigned
  to synsets (synonym sets) corresponding to abstract meanings existing the natural
  language. Synsets, together with their lexico-semantic relations are the essential
  components of every WordNet. The main idea of a new approach to sentiment assignment
  in WordNet based on relational propagation is presented in the paper.
