Its crucial tool are sentiment polarities assigned to synsets (synonym sets) corresponding to abstract meanings existing the natural language. Synsets, together with their lexico-semantic relations are the essential components of every WordNet. The main idea of a new approach to sentiment assignment in WordNet based on relational propagation is presented in the paper.},
