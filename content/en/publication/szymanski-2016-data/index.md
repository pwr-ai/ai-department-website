abstract: We propose using five data-driven community detection approaches from social
  networks to partition the label space in the task of multi-label classification
  as an alternative to random partitioning into equal subsets as performed by RA k
  EL d. We evaluate modularity-maximizing using fast greedy and leading eigenvector
  approximations, infomap, walktrap and label propagation algorithms. For this purpose,
  we propose to construct a label co-occurrence graph (both weighted and unweighted
  versions) based on training data and
