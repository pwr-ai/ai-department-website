abstract: Relations between objects in various systems, such as hyperlinks connecting
  web pages, citations of scientific papers, conversations via email or social interactions
  in Web 2.0 portals are commonly modeled by networks. One of many interesting problems
  currently studied for such domains is node classification. Due to the nature of
  the networked data and the unavailability of collection of nodes' broad representation
  for training in majority of environments, only a very limited data may remain useful
  for classification. Therefore, there
