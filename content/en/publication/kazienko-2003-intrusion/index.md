abstract: Due to a growing number of intrusions and since the Internet and local networks
  have become so ubiquitous, organizations increasingly implementing various systems
  that monitor IT security breaches. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are those that
  have recently gained a considerable amount of interest. This is an introductory
  article to this topic. It gives an overview of several types of detectable attacks,
  symptoms that help in intrusion detection, describes IDS tasks, different architectures
  and concepts in this field.
