abstract: The web spam detection problem was considered in the paper. Based on interconnected
  spam and no-spam hosts a collective classification approach based on label propagation
  is aimed at discovering the spam hosts. Each host is represented as network node
  and links between hosts constitute network's edges. The proposed method provides
  reasonable results and is able to compute large data as is settled in MapReduce
  programming model.
