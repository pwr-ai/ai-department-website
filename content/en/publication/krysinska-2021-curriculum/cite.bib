 abstract = {The technique of curriculum learning mimics cognitive mechanisms observed in human learning, where simpler concepts are presented prior to gradual introduction of more difficult concepts. Until now, the major obstacle for curriculum methods was the lack of a reliable method for estimating the difficulty of training instances. In this paper we show that, instead of trying to assess the difficulty of learning instances, a simple graph-based method of computing the typicality of instances can be used in conjunction with curriculum methods},
