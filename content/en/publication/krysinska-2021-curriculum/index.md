abstract: The technique of curriculum learning mimics cognitive mechanisms observed
  in human learning, where simpler concepts are presented prior to gradual introduction
  of more difficult concepts. Until now, the major obstacle for curriculum methods
  was the lack of a reliable method for estimating the difficulty of training instances.
  In this paper we show that, instead of trying to assess the difficulty of learning
  instances, a simple graph-based method of computing the typicality of instances
  can be used in conjunction with curriculum methods
