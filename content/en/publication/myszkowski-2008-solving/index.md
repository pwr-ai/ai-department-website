abstract: 'This chapter presents a new evolutionary approach to the Graph Coloring
  Problem (GCP) as a generalization of some scheduling problems: timetabling, scheduling,
  multiprocessor scheduling task and other assignment problems. The proposed evolutionary
  approach to the Graph Coloring Problem utilizes information about the conflict localization
  in a given coloring. In this context a partial fitness function (pff) and its usage
  to specialize genetic operators (IBIS and BCX) and phenotypic measure of diversity
  in population are described'
