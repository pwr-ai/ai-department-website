abstract: EN The work describes methods used in a laboratory order form recognition
  module of a hospital information system. Three-level form analysis architecture
  is proposed. The lower alphabetical level is responsible for separate character
  recognition. On the intermediate level, recognised strings are verified against
  the lexicons of items specific for a particular form field. Probabilistic model
  is used to select the set of most probable items. On the upper level, the dependencies
  between the form data items are taken into account to further
