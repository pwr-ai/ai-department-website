abstract: We propose a novel method of homonymy-polysemy discrimination for three
  Indo-European Languages (English, Spanish and Polish). Support vector machines and
  LASSO logistic regression were successfully used in this task, outperforming baselines.
  The feature set utilised lemma properties, gloss similarities, graph distances and
  polysemy patterns. The proposed ML models performed equally well for English and
  the other two languages (constituting testing data sets). The algorithms not only
  ruled out most cases of homonymy
