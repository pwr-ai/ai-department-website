abstract: This paper presents the original concept of computer-aided medical decisions,
  which simultaneously uses the information contained in the case records and expert
  rules. Adopting the probabilistic model of diagnostic problem the rule-based decision
  algorithm with learning is presented. Proposed algorithm was applied practically
  to the diagnosis of acute renal failure in children. Obtained results have proved
  its effectiveness in the computer medical decision-making.
