abstract: This paper presents a concept of bidirectional probabilistic character language
  model and its application to handwriting recognition. Character language model describes
  probability distribution of adjacent character combinations in words. Bidirectional
  model applies word analysis from left to right and in reversed order, ie it uses
  conditional probabilities of character succession and character precedence. Character
  model is used for HMM creation, which is applied as a soft word classifier. Two
  HMMs are created for left-to-right and right-to
