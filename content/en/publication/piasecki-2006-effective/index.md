abstract: The large tagset of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish and the limited size of
  the learning corpus make construction of a tagger especially demanding. The goal
  of this work is to decompose the overall process of tagging of Polish into subproblems
  of partial disambiguation. Moreover, an architecture of a tagger facilitating this
  decomposition is proposed. The proposed architecture enables easy integration of
  hand-written tagging rules with the rest of the tagger. The architecture is open
  for different types of classifiers. A complete tagger for
