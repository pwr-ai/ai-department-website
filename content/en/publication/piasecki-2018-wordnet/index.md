abstract: The paper presents construction of large scale test datasets for word embeddings
  on the basis of a very large wordnet. They were next applied for evaluation of word
  embedding models and used to assess and compare the usefulness of different word
  embeddings extracted from a very large corpus of Polish. We analysed also and compared
  several publicly available models described in literature. In addition, several
  large word embeddings models built on the basis of a very large Polish corpus are
  presented.
