abstract: In the paper the method of handprinted word recognition is described, which
  combines statistical lexical language model and character classifier properties
  in order to improve the recognition accuracy. The statistical lexical model determines
  the conditional probabilities of letters succession in the language. For some letters
  in polish language only very small subset of successors appears with significant
  conditional probability. If the confidence of predecessor recognition is assessed
  as high then the recognition of successor can be
