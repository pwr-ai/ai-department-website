abstract: Computations related to learning processes within an organizational social
  network area require some network model preparation and specific algorithms in order
  to implement human behaviors in simulated environments. The proposals in this research
  model of collaborative learning in an organizational social network are based on
  knowledge resource distribution through the establishment of a knowledge flow. The
  nodes, which represent knowledge workers, contain information about workers' social
  and cognitive abilities
