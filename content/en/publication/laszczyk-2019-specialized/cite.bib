 abstract = {In the recent years, it has been shown that real world-problems are often comprised of two, interdependent subproblems. Often, solving them independently does not lead to the solution to the entire problem. In this article, a Travelling Thief Problem is considered, which combines a Travelling Salesman Problem with a Knapsack Problem. A Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is investigated, along with its recent modification-a Non-Dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm (NTGA). Each method is investigated in two},
