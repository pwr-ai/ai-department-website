abstract: In the recent years, it has been shown that real world-problems are often
  comprised of two, interdependent subproblems. Often, solving them independently
  does not lead to the solution to the entire problem. In this article, a Travelling
  Thief Problem is considered, which combines a Travelling Salesman Problem with a
  Knapsack Problem. A Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is investigated,
  along with its recent modification-a Non-Dominated Tournament Genetic Algorithm
  (NTGA). Each method is investigated in two
