abstract: "This paper presents a software library as a research and educational tool\
  \ for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Scheduling Problem. The following useful\
  \ tools have been implemented in Java: instance Generator, solution validator, solution\
  \ visualizer and example solvers: Greedy algorithm and Genetic Algorithm. All tools\
  \ are supported by iMOPSE dataset which consists of 36 instances and additional'small'6\
  \ instances for educational purpose. In the paper, three test studies are described:(1)\
  \ educational use of 6'small'instances,(2)"
