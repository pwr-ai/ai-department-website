abstract: Many publications prove that the creation of a multiobjective machine learning
  model is possible and reasonable. Moreover, we can see significant gains in expanding
  the knowledge domain, increasing prediction quality, and reducing the inference
  time. New developments in cross-lingual knowledge transfer open up a range of possibilities,
  particularly in working with low-resource languages. With a motivation to explore
  the latest subfields of natural language processing and their interactions, we decided
  to create a multi
