abstract: In the paper different methods of construction of language models are discussed
  in relation to a corpora of medical texts written in an inflective language, namely
  Polish. The main result is the proposal of a method of language modelling which
  sequentially combines tri-grams of morphological base forms with tri-grams of words.
  The introduction of base form tri-grams increased the overall performance of the
  combined model, measured as the improvement in the accuracy of OCR of handwriting,
  as well, as the ability to generalisation. The latter was
