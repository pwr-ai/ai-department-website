abstract: The data gathered in all kinds of web-based systems, which enable users
  to interact with each other, provides an opportunity to extract social networks
  that consist of people and relationships between them. The emerging structures are
  very complex due to the number and type of discovered connections. In web-based
  systems, the characteristic element of each interaction between users is that there
  is always an object that serves as a communication medium. This can be, for example,
  an e-mail sent from one user to another
