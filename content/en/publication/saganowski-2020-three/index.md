abstract: In the era of universal digitization, ensuring network and data security
  is extremely important. As a part of the Regional Center for Cybersecurity initiative,
  a three-stage machine learning network security solution is being developed and
  will be deployed in March 2021. The solution consists of prevention, monitoring,
  and curation stages. As prevention, we utilize Natural Language Processing to extract
  the security-related information from social media, news portals, and darknet. A
  deep learning architecture is used to monitor the network in
