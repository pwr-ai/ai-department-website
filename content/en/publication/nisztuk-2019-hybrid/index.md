abstract: 'The article presents the application of Hybrid Evolutionary and Greedy-based
  algorithms to the problem of Automated Floor Plan Generation. The described optimization
  issue is part of a wider domain of Computer-Aided Architectural Design. The article
  covers the extensive description of the representation domain model (architectural
  canonical guidelines, user design requirements and constraints) and the explanation
  of proposed approach: problem representation, genetic algorithm operators, and fitness
  function definition. The research'
