abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to the construction of an extensive,
  sense-level sentiment lexicon built on the basis of a wordnet. The main aim of this
  work is to create a high-quality sentiment lexicon in a partially automated way.
  We propose a method called Classifier-based Polarity Propagation, which utilises
  a very rich set of wordnet-based features, to recognize and assign specific sentiment
  polarity values to wordnet senses. We have demonstrated that in comparison to the
  existing rule-base solutions using specific
