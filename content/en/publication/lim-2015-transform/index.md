abstract: Evidence-based practice has become the cornerstone of high quality clinical
  care. However, producing evidence of sufficient quantity and quality is hampered
  by the high cost and complexity of conducting research, the numbers of clinicians
  and patients willing to participate in clinical trials. The Learning Healthcare
  System initiative creates routes for knowledge transfer between different parts
  of the health system, thereby increasing its research and learning capacity. This
  effort is closely aligned with initiatives such as CDISC
