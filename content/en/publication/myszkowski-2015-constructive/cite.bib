 abstract = {In this paper, we define a new practical technology-driven Resource Constrained Scheduling Problem (t-RCPSP). We propose three approaches, applying constructive heuristics to tackle effectively the practical application of RCPSP. In the RCPSP formulation, the constraints are defined to design the tasks in the spaces constructed by non-and renewable resources, without violating the precedence relationships and technologies in real world problem that exists in Plastic and Rubber Processing company. The difficulty of t},
