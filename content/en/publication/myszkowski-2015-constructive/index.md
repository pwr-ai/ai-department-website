abstract: In this paper, we define a new practical technology-driven Resource Constrained
  Scheduling Problem (t-RCPSP). We propose three approaches, applying constructive
  heuristics to tackle effectively the practical application of RCPSP. In the RCPSP
  formulation, the constraints are defined to design the tasks in the spaces constructed
  by non-and renewable resources, without violating the precedence relationships and
  technologies in real world problem that exists in Plastic and Rubber Processing
