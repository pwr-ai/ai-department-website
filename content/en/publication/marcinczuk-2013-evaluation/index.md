abstract: 'We report on our efforts aimed at building an Open Domain Question Answering
  system for Polish. Our contribution is twofold: we gathered a set of question–answer
  pairs from various Polish sources and we performed an empirical evaluation of two
  re-ranking methods. The gathered collection contains factoid, list, non-factoid
  and yes-no questions, which makes a challenging material for experiments. We show
  that using two re-ranking methods based on term proximity allows to obtain significant
  improvement on simple information retrieval'
