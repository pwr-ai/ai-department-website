abstract: In this paper we present a comprehensive overview of recent methods of the
  sentiment propagation in a wordnet. Next, we propose a fully automated method called
  Classifier-based Polarity Propagation, which utilises a very rich set of features,
  where most of them are based on wordnet relation types, multi-level bag-of-synsets
  and bag-of-polarities. We have evaluated our solution using manually annotated part
  of plWordNet 3.1 emo, which contains more than 83k manual sentiment annotations,
  covering more than 41k synsets. We have
