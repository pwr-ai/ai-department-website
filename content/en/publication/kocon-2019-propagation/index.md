abstract: In this paper we present a novel method for emotive propagation in a wordnet
  based on a large emotive seed. We introduce a sense-level emotive lexicon annotated
  with polarity, arousal and emotions. The data were annotated as a part of a large
  study involving over 20,000 participants. A total of 30,000 lexical units in Polish
  WordNet were described with metadata, each unit received about 50 annotations concerning
  polarity, arousal and 8 basic emotions, marked on a multilevel scale. We present
  a preliminary approach to propagating
