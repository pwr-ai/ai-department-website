abstract: Social networks can be extracted from different data about communication
  or common activities in organizations, companies or various Internet-based services.
  Different types of data processed may result in creation of separate layers in the
  complex multilayered social network. Analysis of neighbourhoods of network members
  and their utilization to social group discovery appears to be an interesting and
  important research domain. Since there is no measure to evaluate structure of the
  neighbourhoods in the multilayered social network
