abstract: The paper is devoted to the pattern recognition procedure based on the set
  of expert rules with unprecisely formulated weights understood as conditional probabilities.
  Adopting the probabilistic model, the recognition algorithm is derived and evaluation
  of its probability of misclassification is given. Furthermore, the case with both
  expert rules and the learning set is considered. The proposed algorithms were empirically
  tested on the computer generated data and in computer aided diagnosis of acute renal
  failure and compared with sample
