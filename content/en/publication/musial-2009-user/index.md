abstract: Network analysis offers many centrality measures that are successfully utilized
  in the process of investigating the social network profile. The most important and
  representative measures are presented in the paper. It includes indegree centrality,
  proximity prestige, rank prestige, node position, outdegree centrality, eccentrality,
  closeness centrality, and betweenes centrality. Both feature analysis and experimental
  comparative studies revealed the general profile of selected measures.
