abstract: Avaya Conversational Intelligence (ACI) is an end-to-end, cloud-based solution
  for real-time Spoken Language Understanding for call centers. It combines large
  vocabulary, real-time speech recognition, transcript refinement, and entity and
  intent recognition in order to convert live audio into a rich, actionable stream
  of structured events. These events can be further leveraged with a business rules
  engine, thus serving as a foundation for real-time supervision and assistance applications.
  After the ingestion, calls are enriched with
