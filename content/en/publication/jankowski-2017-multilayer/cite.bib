 abstract = {Presented data contains the record of five spreading campaigns that occurred in a virtual world platform. Users distributed avatars between each other during the campaigns. The processes varied in time and range and were either incentivized or not incentivized. Campaign data is accompanied by events.

To the best of the authors' knowledge, the study is the first publicly available dataset containing a complete real multilayer social},
