abstract: Presented data contains the record of five spreading campaigns that occurred
  in a virtual world platform. Users distributed avatars between each other during
  the campaigns. The processes varied in time and range and were either incentivized
  or not incentivized. Campaign data is accompanied by events. The data can be used
  to build a multilayer network to place the campaigns in a wider context. To the
  best of the authors' knowledge, the study is the first publicly available dataset
  containing a complete real multilayer social
