abstract: It is proposed in the paper a new method for structured output prediction
  using ensemble of classifiers composed on the basis of Error-Correcting Output Codes.
  It was presented that newly presented Multiple Classifier Method for Structured
  Output Prediction based on Error Correcting Output Codes requires comparable computation
  time in comparison to other accurate algorithms and simultaneously in the classification
  of more complex structures it provides much better results in the same computation
  time.
