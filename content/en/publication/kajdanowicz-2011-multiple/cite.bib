 abstract = {It is proposed in the paper a new method for structured output prediction using ensemble of classifiers composed on the basis of Error-Correcting Output Codes. It was presented that newly presented Multiple Classifier Method for Structured Output Prediction based on Error Correcting Output Codes requires comparable computation time in comparison to other accurate algorithms and simultaneously in the classification of more complex structures it provides much better results in the same computation time.},
