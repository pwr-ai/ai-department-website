abstract: In this article we present the result of the recent research in the recognition
  and normalisation of Polish temporal expressions. The temporal information extracted
  from the text plays major role in many information extraction systems, like question
  answering, event recognition or discourse analysis. We proposed a new method for
  the temporal expressions normalisation, called Cascade of Partial Rules. Here we
  describe results achieved by updated version of Liner2 machine learning system.
