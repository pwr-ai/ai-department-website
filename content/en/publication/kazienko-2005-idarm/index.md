abstract: 'Typical association rules, called in the paper “direct”, reflect relationships
  existing between items that relatively often co-occur in common transactions. In
  the web domain items correspond to pages and transactions to user sessions. The
  main idea of new approach is to discover indirect associations existing between
  pages that rarely occur together but there are other,“third” pages, called transitive,
  with which they appear relatively frequently. Two types of indirect associations
  rules are described in the paper: partial indirect associations'
