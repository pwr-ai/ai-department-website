abstract: In the paper a method of the correction of handwriting Optical Character
  Recognition (OCR) based on the semantic similarity is presented. Different versions
  of the extraction of semantic similarity measures from a corpus are analysed, with
  the best results achieved for the combination of the text window context and Rank
  Weight Function. An algorithm of the word sequence selection with the high internal
  similarity is proposed. The method was trained and applied to a corpus of real medical
  documents written in Polish.
