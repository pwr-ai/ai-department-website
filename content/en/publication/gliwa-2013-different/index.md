abstract: Predicting the future direction of community evolution is a problem with
  high theoretical and practical significance. It allows to determine which characteristics
  describing communities have importance from the point of view of their future behaviour.
  Knowledge about the probable future career of the community aids in the decision
  concerning investing in contact with members of a given community and carrying out
  actions to achieve a key position in it. It also allows to determine effective ways
  of forming opinions or to protect group participants
