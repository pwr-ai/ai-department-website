abstract: The growing volume of Internet traffic, increasing popularity of streaming
  services, and limited scalability of existing network techniques trigger the need
  to develop new delivery solutions based on a multicasting approach. Multicasting—defined
  as a one-to-many delivery technique—enables effective distribution of many kinds
  of content to end users. In this article we focus on peer-to-peer (P2P) multicasting,
  which combines concepts of P2P systems and multicasting solutions; in other words,
  the multicast tree is constructed using
