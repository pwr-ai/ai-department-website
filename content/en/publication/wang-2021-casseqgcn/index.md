abstract: One important task in the study of information cascade is to predict the
  future recipients of a message given its past spreading trajectory. While the network
  structure serves as the backbone of the spreading, an accurate prediction can hardly
  be made without the knowledge of the dynamics on the network. The temporal information
  in the spreading sequence captures many hidden features, but predictions based on
  sequence alone have their limitations. Recent efforts start to explore the possibility
  of combining both the network
