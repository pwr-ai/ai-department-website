 abstract = {The customers of modern telecommunication service providers implicitly create an interactive social network of individuals, which both depend on and influence each other through various complex social relationships grown on friendship, shared interests, locality, etc. While delivering services on the individual basis, the social network effects exerted from customer-to-customer interactions remain virtually unexplored and unexploited. The focus of the paper is on customer churn and acquisition, where social neighbourhood effects are},
