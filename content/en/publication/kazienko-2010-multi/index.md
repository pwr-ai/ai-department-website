abstract: A method for extraction of the multi-layered social network based on the
  data about human collaborative achievements, in particular scientific papers, is
  presented in the paper. The objects linking people form a hierarchy, which is flattened
  in the pre-processing stage. Only one level of the hierarchy remains together with
  new activities moved from its other levels. Separate layers of the multi-layered
  social network are created based on these pre-processed activities.
