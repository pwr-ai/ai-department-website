abstract: Since its inception a quarter century ago, Princeton WordNet [PWN](Miller
  1995; Fellbaum 1998) has had a profound influence on research and applications in
  lexical semantics, computational linguistics and natural language processing. The
  numerous uses of this lexical resource have motivated the building of wordnets 1
  in several dozen languages, including even a ''dead''language, Latin. This special
  issue looks at certain aspects of wordnet construction and organisation. There are
  diverse methods of wordnet construction
