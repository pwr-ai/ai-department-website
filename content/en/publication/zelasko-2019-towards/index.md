abstract: In this paper, we present a method for correcting automatic speech recognition
  (ASR) errors using a finite state transducer (FST) intent recognition framework.
  Intent recognition is a powerful technique for dialog flow management in turn-oriented,
  human-machine dialogs. This technique can also be very useful in the context of
  human-human dialogs, though it serves a different purpose of key insight extraction
  from conversations. We argue that currently available intent recognition techniques
  are not applicable to human-human dialogs
