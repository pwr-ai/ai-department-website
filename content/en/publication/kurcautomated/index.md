abstract: The paper presents an algorithm of automated mapping of Proper Names onto
  plWordNet (a Polish wordnet) synsets. The algorithm is a modification of Algorithm
  of Activation-area Attachment used for wordnet expansion. Evidence provided by different
  knowledge sources is analysed on the level of lexical units and their location in
  the wordnet structure. Influence of each knowledge source on the local context can
  be tuned to its characteristics. The algorithm was applied to a large set of Polish
  Proper Names and a set of heterogeneous
