abstract: Automated calibration is a crucial stage when validating non-linear dynamic
  systems. The modeler must control the calibration results and analyze parameter
  values in an iterative way. In many non-linear models, it is usual to find sets
  of configuration parameters that may obtain the same model fitting. In these cases,
  the modeler needs to understand the results' implications and run a sensitivity
  analysis to check the model validity. This paper presents a framework based on niching
  genetic algorithms to provide modeler with a set of alternative
