abstract: 'It is a common problem that cost of extracting data for network analysis
  could be very high. Also sometimes in the Internet is it hard to find graph with
  desired features such as node degree or clustering level. Because of that graph
  generators can than be very helpful. In the past bunch of models of such generators
  was developed: random graphs, small worlds and scale free networks. All of these
  generators were developed to quickly and efficiently create networks with desired
  parameters. However all of this models produce single layer graphs'
