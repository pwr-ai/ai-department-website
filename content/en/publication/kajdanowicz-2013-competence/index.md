abstract: Relational classification is a promising branch of machine learning techniques
  for classification in networked environments which does not fulfil the iid assumption
  (independent and identically distributed). During the past few years, researchers
  have proposed many relational classification methods. However, almost none of them
  was able to work efficiently with large amounts of data or sparsely labelled networks.
  It is introduced in this paper a new approach to relational classification based
  on competence region
