abstract: Many text processing tasks require to recognize and classify Named Entities.
  Currently available morphological analysers for Polish cannot handle unknown words
  (not included in analyser's lexicon). Polish is a language with rich inflection,
  so comparing two words (even having the same lemma) is a non-trivial task. The aim
  of the similarity function is to match unknown word form with its word form in named-entity
  dictionary. In this article a complex similarity function is presented. It is based
  on a decision function implemented as a Logistic
