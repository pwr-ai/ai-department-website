 abstract = {Our paper presents a modular architecture for a natural dialogue system. The architecture is applied in the construction of Logo-a dialogue system for Polish, based on the Discourse Representation theory, implementing some aspects of the pragmatic analysis and enabling communication with an agent acting in the virtual reality of a blocks world. Logo deals also with the selected issues of coreference resolution. The proposed architecture is intended to be flexible and open for utilisation of diverged language resources.},
