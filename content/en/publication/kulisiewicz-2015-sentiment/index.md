abstract: 'Sentiment analysis is a very active and nowadays highly addressed research
  area. One of the problem in sentiment analysis is text classification in terms of
  its attitude, especially in reviews or comments from social media. In general, this
  problem can be solved by two different approaches: machine learning methods and
  based on lexicons. Methods based on lexicons require properly prepared lexicons
  which usually are obtained manually from experts and it costs a lot in terms of
  time and resources. This paper aims at automatic lexicon'
