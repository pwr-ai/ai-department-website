 abstract = {In this work we compare different methods for deriving features for text representation in two stylometric tasks of gender and author recognition. The first group of methods uses the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach, which represents the documents with vectors of frequencies of selected features occurring in the documents. We analyze features such as the most frequent 1000 lemmas, word forms, all lemmas, selected (content insensitive) lemmas, bigrams of grammatical classes and mixture of bigrams of grammatical classes, selected},
