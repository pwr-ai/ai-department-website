abstract: In this work we compare different methods for deriving features for text
  representation in two stylometric tasks of gender and author recognition. The first
  group of methods uses the Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach, which represents the documents
  with vectors of frequencies of selected features occurring in the documents. We
  analyze features such as the most frequent 1000 lemmas, word forms, all lemmas,
  selected (content insensitive) lemmas, bigrams of grammatical classes and mixture
  of bigrams of grammatical classes, selected
