abstract: This paper presents document search model based on its visual content. There
  is used hierarchical clustering algorithm-GHSOM. Description of proposed model is
  given as learning and searching phase. Also some experiments are described on benchmark
  image sets (eg ICPR, MIRFlickr) and created document set. Paper presents some experiments
  connected with document measures and their influence on searching results. Also
  in this paper some first results are given and directions of further research are
  given.
