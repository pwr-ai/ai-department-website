abstract: Lexical resources are crucial in many modern applications of Natural Language
  Processing and Artificial Intelligence. We present VeSNetâ€“a network of lexical resources
  resulting from the merge of Polish-English WordNet (PEWN) with several existing
  large electronic thesauri from the Linked Open Data cloud (DBpedia, Wikipedia, GeoWordNet,
  Agrovoc, Eurovoc, Gemet and MeSH). We describe the procedure of making the resource
  and depict its elementary properties, as well as, evaluate its quality. The created
  lexical network is
