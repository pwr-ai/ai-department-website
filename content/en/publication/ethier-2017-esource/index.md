abstract: Objective The Learning Health System (LHS) requires integration of research
  into routine practice.'eSource'or embedding clinical trial functionalities into
  routine electronic health record (EHR) systems has long been put forward as a solution
  to the rising costs of research. We aimed to create and validate an eSource solution
  that would be readily extensible as part of a LHS. Materials and Methods The EU
  FP7 TRANSFoRm project's approach is based on dual modelling, using the Clinical
  Research Information Model
