abstract: WindOwls, the new hybrid system of personalized product recommendation in
  e-commerce, by integrating various methods, is presented in the paper. Each e-commerce
  user has assigned their own weights corresponding to particular methods. Due to
  the permanent and personalized adaptation of these weights, WindOwls can adjust
  the influence of individual methods. Testing implementation and evaluation of recommendation
  efficiency are also described.
