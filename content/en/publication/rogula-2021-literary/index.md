abstract: Robust methods have been proposed for content and topic-based text classification,
  as well authorship attribution in stylometry. However, the problem of a fine-grained
  literary genre (style) recognition is much less studied. We present several approaches

  classifiers, including deep, recursive neural networks. Very good results were achieved
  for the representation of blog posts with
