abstract: Verbs usually make up 10-15% of the material in a wordnet. We have embarked
  on a project in which this proportion increases to a lexically more realistic 1/3.
  The development of plWordNet 2.0 has been geared toward building up the verb hierarchy
  very considerably. The scaffolding upon which this part of our wordnet will rest
  is a detailed system of semantic relations. The selection of relations is informed
  by the linguistic accounts of Polish lexical semantics, notably the derivational
  procedures. The paper presents the background
