abstract: The complex nature of big data resources requires new structuring methods,
  especially for textual content. WordNet is a good knowledge source for the comprehensive
  abstraction of natural language as it offers good implementation for many languages.
  Since WordNet embeds natural language in the form of a complex network, a transformation
  mechanism, WordNet2Vec, is proposed in this paper. This creates vectors for each
  word from WordNet. These vectors encapsulate a general positionâ€”the role of a given
  word related to all other
