abstract: 'Stochastic approaches to tagging of Polish brought results far from being
  satisfactory. However, successful combination of hand-written rules and a stochastic
  approach to Czech, as well, as some initial experiments in acquisition of tagging
  rules for Polish revealed potential capabilities of a rule based approach. The goals
  are: to define a language of tagging constraints, to construct a set of reduction
  rules for Polish and to apply Machine Learning to extraction of tagging rules. A
  language of functional tagging constraints called'
