abstract: This article presents an extended version of the SuperMatrix system–a general
  tool supporting automatic acquisition of lexical semantic relations from corpora.
  Extensions focus mainly on parallel processing of massive amounts of data. The construction
  of the system is discussed. Three distributed parts of the system are presented,
  ie, distributed construction of co-incidence matrices from corpora, computation
  of similarity matrix and parallel solving of synonymy tests. An evaluation of a
  proposed approach to parallel processing is shown
