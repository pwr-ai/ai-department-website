abstract: Political campaigns are full of political ads posted by candidates on social
  media. Political advertisements constitute a basic form of campaigning, subjected
  to various social requirements. We present the first publicly open dataset for detecting
  specific text chunks and categories of political advertising in the Polish language.
  It contains 1,705 human-annotated tweets tagged with nine categories, which constitute
  campaigning under Polish electoral law. We achieved a 0.65 inter-annotator agreement
  (Cohen's kappa score). An
