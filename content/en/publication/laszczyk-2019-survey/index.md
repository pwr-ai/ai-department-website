abstract: In recent years interest in multiobjective optimization has flourished.
  Many Quality Measures (QM) have been developed to allow comparison of results gained
  by many methods. Unfortunately significant amount of various QMs along with the
  lack of imposed taxonomy have caused vagueness in the naming conventions. Hence
  a cohesive taxonomy is proposed that allows for classification of both existing
  and future QMs. This paper additionally provides thorough description of recently
  used QMs while attempting to unify the
