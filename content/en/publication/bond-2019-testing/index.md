abstract: According to George K. Zipf, more frequent words have more senses. We have
  tested this law using corpora and wordnets of English, Spanish, Portuguese, French,
  Polish, Japanese, Indonesian and Chinese. We have proved that the law works pretty
  well for all of these languages if we take-as Zipf did-mean values of meaning count
  and averaged ranks. On the other hand, the law disastrously fails in predicting
  the number of senses for a single lemma. We have also provided the evidence that
  slope coefficients of Zipfian log-log linear
