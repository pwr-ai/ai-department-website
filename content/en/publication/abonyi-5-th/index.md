abstract: The AAIA'10 will bring researchers, developers, practitioners, and users
  to present their latest research, results, and ideas in all areas of artificial
  intelligence. We hope that theory and successful applications presented at the AAIA'10
  will be of interest to researchers and practitioners who want to know about both
  theoretical advances and latest applied developments in Artificial Intelligence.
  As such AAIA'10 will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between theoreticians
  and practitioners tp address the important issues.
