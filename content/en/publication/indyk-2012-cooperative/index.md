abstract: Recently, due to information explosion in our environment, complex networks
  appear more frequently. Many types of networks, such as social networks, biological
  structures, telecommunication networks and many others, consist of huge amount of
  data which grows exponentially. Obviously, there is a problem with processing such
  big datasets, especially in order to provide support for decisions making. In general,
  structure of networks is not independent. It means behaviour of single node in network
  depends on behaviour of others
