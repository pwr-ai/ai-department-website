 abstract = {Recently, due to information explosion in our environment, complex networks appear more frequently. Many types of networks, such as social networks, biological structures, telecommunication networks and many others, consist of huge amount of data which grows exponentially. Obviously, there is a problem with processing such big datasets, especially in order to provide support for decisions making. In general, structure of networks is not independent. It means behaviour of single node in network depends on behaviour of others},
