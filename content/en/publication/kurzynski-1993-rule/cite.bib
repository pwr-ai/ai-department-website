 abstract = {This paper presents the original concept of computer-aided medical decisions, which simultaneously uses the information contained in the learning set and expert rules. Adopting the probabilistic model of diagnostic problem the rule-based decision algorithm with learning is presented. Proposed algorithm was applied practically to the diagnosis of acute renal failure in children. Obtained results have proved its effectiveness in the computer-aided medical decisionmaking.},
