abstract: This paper presents the original concept of computer-aided medical decisions,
  which simultaneously uses the information contained in the learning set and expert
  rules. Adopting the probabilistic model of diagnostic problem the rule-based decision
  algorithm with learning is presented. Proposed algorithm was applied practically
  to the diagnosis of acute renal failure in children. Obtained results have proved
  its effectiveness in the computer-aided medical decisionmaking.
