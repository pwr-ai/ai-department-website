abstract: In this paper we present a morpho-syntactic tagger dedicated to Computer-mediated
  Communication texts in Polish. Its construction is based on an expanded RNN-based
  neural network adapted to the work on noisy texts. Among several techniques, the
  tagger utilises fastText embedding vectors, sequential character embedding vectors,
  and Brown clustering for the coarse-grained representation of sentence structures.
  In addition a set of manually written rules was proposed for post-processing. The
  system was trained to disambiguate
