abstract: The paper presents an algorithm of the automated wordnet expansion which
  can utilise results produced by both pattern-based and Distributional Similarity
  methods. It is based on the assumption that all relation extraction methods express
  some error, so we cannot identify the exact place (synset) for a new lemma on their
  bases, but an area (a wordnet subgraph). Support for a particular attachment point
  generated by knowledge should be expanded on the surrounding synsets. Moreover,
  the wordnet structure is modelled on the level of links
