abstract: We present experiments with a variety of corpus-based measures applied to
  the problem of constructing semantic similarity functions for Polish nouns. Rich
  inflection in Polish allows us to acquire useful syntactic features without parsing;
  morphosyntactic restrictions checked in a large enough window provide sufficiently
  useful data. A novel feature selection method gives the accuracy of 86% on the WordNet-based
  synonymy test, an improvement of 5% over the previous results.
