abstract: Many approaches to the construction of language tools and acquisition of
  linguistic knowledge from corpora assume the application of some robust shallow
  parser. Construction of such a parser is difficult in the case of inflective languages
  with relaxed word order like Polish. The goal of the work presented here is to analyse
  the extent of knowledge that can be expressed in the form of morphosyntactic constraints
  referring to morphological properties of word forms, and its applications in the
  automatic extraction of syntactic and
