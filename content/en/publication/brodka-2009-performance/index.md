abstract: 'To analyze large social networks a lot of effort and resources are usually
  required. Network analysis offers many centrality measures that are successfully
  utilized in the process of investigating the social network characteristics. One
  of them is node position, which can be used to assess the importance of a given
  node within either the whole social network or the smaller subgroup. Three algorithms
  that can be utilized in the process of node position evaluation are presented in
  the paper: PIN edges, PIN nodes, and PIN hybrid. Also, different'
