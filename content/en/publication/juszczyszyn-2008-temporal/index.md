abstract: Network motifs are small subgraphs that reflect local network topology and
  were shown to be useful for creating profiles that reveal several properties of
  the network. Analysis of three-node motifs (triads) was used in this paper to track
  the temporal changes in the structure of large social network derived from email
  communication between the employees of Wroclaw University of Technology.
