abstract: The article presents the method of building compact language model for speech
  recognition in devices with limited amount of memory. Most popularly used bigram
  word-based language models allow for highly accurate speech recognition but need
  large amount of memory to store, mainly due to the big number of word bigrams. The
  method proposed here ranks bigrams according to their importance in speech recognition
  and replaces explicit estimation of less important bigrams probabilities by probabilities
  derived from the class
