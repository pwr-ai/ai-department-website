abstract: With the growing size of a wordnet, it is becoming more and more difficult
  to avoid, identify and eliminate errors in it, especially when a group of editors
  work in parallel. That is the case of plWordNet. Thus we need elaborated tools for
  both error prevention during editing, and diagnostic tools for error detection after
  the work was completed. In this paper, first, we present error prevention mechanisms
  built-in the plWordNet editor application and the system for group-working of a
  linguistic team. Next, we discuss diagnostic tests and
