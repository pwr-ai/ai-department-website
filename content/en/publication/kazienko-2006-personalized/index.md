abstract: The hybrid system of personalized product recommendation in e-commerce,
  by integrating various methods, was presented in the paper. Each e-commerce user
  has assigned their own weights corresponding to particular methods. Due to the permanent
  and personalized adaptation of these weights, the system can adjust the influence
  of individual methods separately for each user. Testing the implementation and evaluation
  of recommendation efficiency were also described.
