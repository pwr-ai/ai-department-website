abstract: The relational label propagation problem for large data sets using MapReduce
  programming model was considered in the paper. The method we propose estimates class
  probability in relational domain in the networks. The method was examined on large
  real telecommunication data set. The results indicated that it could be used successfully
  to classify networks' nodes and, thanks to that, new offerings or tariffs might
  be proposed to customers who belong to other providers. Moreover, basic properties
  of relational label
