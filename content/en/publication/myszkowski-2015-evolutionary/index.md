abstract: The university course timetabling problem is hard and time-consuming to
  solve. Profits from full automatisation of this process can be invaluable. This
  paper describes architecture and operation of two automatic timetabling systems.
  Both are based on evolutionary algorithms, with specialised genetic operators and
  penalty-based evaluation function. The paper covers two problem variations (theorethical
  and real-world), with different sets of constraints and different representations.
  Moreover, specification of both solutions and a proposal of hybrid
