abstract: Sequence prediction problem has been traditionally identified in the literature
  with sequence labeling. This approach typically corresponds to the classification
  of a label sequence associated to observed input sequence. However, another interpretation
  of sequence prediction may be considered where a label sequence (sequential output)
  is classified based only on the independent set of attributes. The paper presents
  a new, based on boosting, ensemble approach, performing such sequential output prediction.
