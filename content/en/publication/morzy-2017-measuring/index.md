abstract: One of the most popular methods of estimating the complexity of networks
  is to measure the entropy of network invariants, such as adjacency matrices or degree
  sequences. Unfortunately, entropy and all entropy-based information-theoretic measures
  have several vulnerabilities. These measures neither are independent of a particular
  representation of the network nor can capture the properties of the generative process,
  which produces the network. Instead, we advocate the use of the algorithmic entropy
  as the basis for complexity
