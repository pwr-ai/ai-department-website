abstract: In the paper an evaluation and optimisation framework for medical data access
  systems user interface is presented. User interface design seems to be of crucial
  importance for clinical data access applications acceptance, in particular for the
  applications running on handheld computers where the interface tools are significantly
  limited. The ease of program use depends strongly on the correct user interface
  design and on the algorithms which try to predict the user decisions and interactions
  made in the process of data access or
