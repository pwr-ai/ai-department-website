abstract: In the paper, three-level hand-writing recognition using language syntactic
  properties on the upper level is presented. Isolated characters are recognized on
  the lowest level. The character classification from the lowest level is used in
  words recognition. Words are recognized using a combined classifier based on possibly
  incomplete unigram lexicon. Word classifier builds a rank of the most likely words.
  Ranks created for subsequent words are input to the syntactic classifier, which
  recognizes the whole sentences. Here the local
