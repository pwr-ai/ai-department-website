 abstract = {In the paper, three-level hand-writing recognition using language syntactic properties on the upper level is presented. Isolated characters are recognized on the lowest level. The character classification from the lowest level is used in words recognition. Words are recognized using a combined classifier based on possibly incomplete unigram lexicon. Word classifier builds a rank of the most likely words. Ranks created for subsequent words are input to the syntactic classifier, which recognizes the whole sentences. Here the local},
