abstract: There is content such as hate speech, offensive, toxic or aggressive documents,
  which are perceived differently by their consumers. They are commonly identified
  using classifiers solely based on textual content that generalize pre-agreed meanings

  leads to high misclassification rate observable especially for contentious, aggressive
  documents. Both document controversy and user nonconformity require new solutions.
  Therefore, we propose novel

  Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing
  (Volume 1: Long Papers)*'
