abstract: HE AAIA'14 will bring researchers, developers, practi- tioners, and users
  to present their latest  research, results, and ideas in all areas of artificial
  intelligence. We hope that theory and successful  applications presented at the
  AAIA'14 will be of interest to researchers and practitioners who  want to know about
  both theoretical advances and latest applied developments in Artificial  Intelligence.
  As such AAIA'14 will provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between theo- reticians  and
  practitioners to address the important issues. T TOPICS Papers related to theories
