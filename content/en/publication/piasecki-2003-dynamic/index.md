abstract: The main goal of the work presented here is the construction of fully compositional
  representation of nominal anaphora in discourse. The proposed representation does
  not depend on the remote ascription (done outside the formal representation) of
  syntactic indexes, identifying anaphoric links. A formal language, based on dynamic
  semantics paradigm and being a variant of many-sorted type logic, is introduced.
  An indeterministic reference operator using structural and descriptive information,
  and creating links between
