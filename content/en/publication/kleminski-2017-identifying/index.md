abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate an interpretable definition of promising
  research topics, complemented with a predictive model. Two methods of topic identification
  were employed: bag of words and the LDA model, with reflection on their applicability
  and usefulness in the task of retrieving topics on a set of publication titles.
  Next, different criteria for promising topic were analyzed with respect to their
  usefulness and shortcomings. For verification purposes, the DBLP data set, an online
  open reference of computer science publications, is used. The'
publication: '*European Network Intelligence Conference*'
