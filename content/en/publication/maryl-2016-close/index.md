abstract: The existing typologies of weblog genres-both popular and academic-are based
  on the blog topic, eg cooking blogs, travels, business (cf. Morrison 2008) or its
  medium, eg vlogs, picture logs (cf. Herring et al. 2005). In order to go beyond
  topical distinctions, Maryl, Niewiadomski and Kidawa (2016) conducted an interpretive
  study on the sample of 322 popular Polish blogs. They adopted a new-rhetorical approach,
  basing on Carolyn Miller's (1994) concept of genre as a social action, concentrating
  mostly on the blog's communicative purpose and
