abstract: Hybrid and ensemble methods in machine learning have gained great attention
  of the scientific community over the last few years. Multiple learning models have
  been theoretically and empirically shown to provide significantly better performance
  than their single base model counterparts. Ensemble algorithms and hybrid methods
  of reasoning have found their application in various real word problems ranging
  from person recognition through medical diagnosis and text classification to financial
  forecasting. This special issue
