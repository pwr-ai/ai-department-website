abstract: We investigate two methods of identifying noun senses, based on clustering
  of lemmas and of documents. We have adapted to Polish the well-known algorithm of
  Clustering by Committee, and tested it on very large Polish corpora. The evaluation
  by means of a WordNet-based synonymy test used Polish wordnet (plWordNet 1.0). Various
  clustering algorithms were analysed for the needs of extraction of document clusters
  as indicators of the senses of words which occur in them. The two approaches to
  wordsense identification
