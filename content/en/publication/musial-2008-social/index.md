abstract: The social recommender system that supports the creation of new relations
  between users in the multimedia sharing system is presented in the paper. To generate
  suggestions the new concept of the multirelational social network was introduced.
  It covers both direct as well as object-based relationships that reflect social
  and semantic links between users. The main goal of the new method is to create the
  personalized suggestions that are continuously adapted to users' needs depending
  on the personal weights assigned to each layer from the
