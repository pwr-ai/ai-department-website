abstract: 'In the paper the multilevel probabilistic approach to handprinted form
  recognition is described. The form recognition is decomposed into three levels:
  character recognition, word recognition and form contents recognition. On the word
  and form contents level the probabilistic lexicons are available. The decision on
  the word level is performed using probabilistic properties of character classifier
  and the contents of probabilistic lexicon. The novel approach to combining these
  two sources of information about classes (words)'
