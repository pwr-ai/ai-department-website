abstract: The application of hybrid and ensemble methodologies in the field of soft
  computing (SC) and machine learning (ML) has become more visible and attractive.
  The relevance of these methodologies is motivated by their power of being able to
  express knowledge contained in data sets in multiple ways, benefiting each of the
  other, ie, exploiting their diversity, thus increasing the performance of sole base
  models in terms of model accuracy and generalization capability by intelligent combination
  strategies, especially while dealing with
