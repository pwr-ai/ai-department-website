abstract: Distance measures, especially between probability density functions, are
  essential in solving machine learning problems. Among classification and clustering,
  data reduction and selection are some of them. In the paper a new distance measure
  for comparing and selecting training datasets is described. The distance between
  two datasets is based on variance of entropy in groups obtained by clustering joint
  datasets. The proposed approach is examined in dataset selection during prediction
  of debt portfolio value. Finally, basic
