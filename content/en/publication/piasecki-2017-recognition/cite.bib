 abstract = {In this article we present the result of the research on the recognition of genuine Polish suicide notes (SNs). We provide useful method to distinguish between SNs and other types of discourse, including counterfeited SNs. The method uses a wide range of word-based and semantic features and it was evaluated using Polish Corpus of Suicide Notes, which contains 1244 genuine SNs, expanded with a manually prepared set of 334 counterfeited SNs and 2200 letter-like texts from the Internet. We utilised the algorithm to create the class},
