abstract: Recently, a variety of model designs and methods have blossomed in the context
  of the sentiment analysis domain. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive
  studies of Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis. We want to fill this gap and propose
  a comparison with ablation analysis of Aspect Term Extraction using various text
  embeddings methods. We particularly focused on simple architectures based on long
  short-term memory (LSTM) with optional conditional random field (CRF) enhancement
  using different pre-trained word embeddings
