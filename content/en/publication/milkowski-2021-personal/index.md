abstract: Analysis of emotions elicited by opinions, comments, or articles commonly
  exploits annotated corpora, in which the labels assigned to documents average the
  views of all annotators, or represent a majority decision. The models trained on
  such data are effective at identifying the general views of the population. However,
  their usefulness for predicting the emotions evoked by the textual content in a
  particular individual is limited. In this paper, we present a study performed on
  a dataset containing 7,000 opinions, each annotated by
publication: '*Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational
  Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing:
  Student Research Workshop*'
