abstract: The novel approach to speaker adaptation within speech recognition system
  basing on late clustering of prototype speakers is presented. For a new speaker
  the speaker prototype is created dynamically on the basis of selected remembered
  prototypes that are similar enough to the new one. The training utterances are prepared
  in an optimized way to decrease training duration without negative influence on
  recognition accuracy.
