abstract: The maintenance of many subpopulations is an important technique employed
  in evolutionary methods. However, the use of a multi-population approach has its
  drawbacks. Among all, it requires spending high amounts of available resources.
  Therefore, the methods that dynamically manage the number of subpopulations gain
  an increasing interest due to their capability of adjusting the subpopulation number
  to their current state. They are shown to be capable of reaching excellent results.
  In this paper, we identify the Long-Way
