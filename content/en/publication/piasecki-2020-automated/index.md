abstract: Wordnets for different languages are linked through synsets-sets of synonymous
  word senses. We present a method of automated transforming synset mapping to sense
  mapping to build a network of translational equivalents. Two heuristics based on
  a cross-lingual distributional similarity model are compared with several variants
  of machine learning based approach exploring different descriptive features. The
  features are extracted from bilingual and monolingual dictionaries and distributional
  semantics models, interpreted against
