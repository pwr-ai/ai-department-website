abstract: Large corpora are often consulted by linguists as a knowledge source with
  respect to lexicon, morphology or syntax. However, there are also several methods
  of automated extraction of semantic properties of language units from corpora. In

  identified limitations. Evidence that can be collected from corpora is confronted
  with the existing models of formalised description of lexical meanings. Two basic
  paradigms of lexical semantics extraction are
