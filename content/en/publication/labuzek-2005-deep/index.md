abstract: The paper presents an attempt at the construction of a wide scale parser
  for English based on Inductive Learning and limited resources. The parser loosely
  preserves the shift-reduce scheme, enriched with powerful actions, and a compound
  Decision Tree instead of the decision table. The attempt originates directly from
  Hermjakob's ideas [3], but an important goal was to analyse possible extensions
  to a wide scale solution. Several supporting heuristics, as well as the overview
  of the development process and experiments, are
