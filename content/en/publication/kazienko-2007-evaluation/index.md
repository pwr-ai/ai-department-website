abstract: A very interesting scientific problem is the assessment of the node position
  within the directed, weighted graph that represents the social network of Internet
  users. The weights of graph arcs are extracted from the data about user mutual communication
  or common activities. The new method of node position analysis, which takes into
  account both the strength of the connections between network nodes and dynamic of
  this strength is presented in the paper. The results of experiments on email dataset
  were described as well.
