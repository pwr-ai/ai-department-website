 abstract = {A very interesting scientific problem is the assessment of the node position within the directed, weighted graph that represents the social network of Internet users. The weights of graph arcs are extracted from the data about user mutual communication or common activities. The new method of node position analysis, which takes into account both the strength of the connections between network nodes and dynamic of this strength is presented in the paper. The results of experiments on email dataset were described as well.},
