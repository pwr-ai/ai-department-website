abstract: Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) is a parameter-less optimization
  method that employs the Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) to discover dependencies
  between genes. The results published so far show that P3 effectiveness is low when
  bimodal trap problems are in use. Therefore, Parameter-less Population Pyramid with
  Feedback (fP3) was proposed. fP3 extends P3 by the feedback operation which improves
  P3's effectiveness when bimodal trap problems are used. However, fP3 is no longer
