abstract: EN The paper presents an attempt to automatic speech recognition of Polish
  spoken medical texts. The attempt resulted in experimental system that can be used
  as a tool for practical applications. The system uses a typical recognition method
  based on Hidden Markov Model and domain-specific language model. Implemented software
  made it possible to conduct many experiments aimed on evaluation of the assumed
  approach usefulness. Obtained experiment results are presented and analyzed. The
  system architecture and the
