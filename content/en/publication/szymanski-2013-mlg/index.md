abstract: Multi-label classification on data sets with large number of labels is a
  practically viable and intractable problem. This paper presents an optimization
  method for the multi-label classification process for data with a high number of
  labels. The newly proposed method starts with label grouping using community detection
  methods on interconnectedness graph of labels based on support sizes for every pair
  of labels. The grouping process is based on modularity-oriented community detection
  methods. Next the data instances are classified
