abstract: 'The link prediction problem in social networks defined as a task to predict
  whether a link between two particular nodes will appear in the future is still a
  broadly researched topic in the field of social network analysis. However, another
  relevant problem is solved in the paper instead of individual link forecasting:
  prediction of key network measures values, what is a more time saving approach.
  Two machine learning techniques were examined: time series forecasting and classification.
  Both of them were tested on two real-life social network'
