 abstract = {The link prediction problem in social networks defined as a task to predict whether a link between two particular nodes will appear in the future is still a broadly researched topic in the field of social network analysis. However, another relevant problem is solved in the paper instead of individual link forecasting: prediction of key network measures values, what is a more time saving approach. Two machine learning techniques were examined: time series forecasting and classification. Both of them were tested on two real-life social network},
