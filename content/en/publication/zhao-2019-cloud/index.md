abstract: In smart factories, process planning and scheduling need to be performed
  every time a new manufacturing order is received or a factory state change has been
  detected. A new plan and schedule need to be determined quickly to increase the
  responsiveness of the factory and enlarge its profit. Simultaneous optimisation
  of manufacturing process planning and scheduling leads to better results than a
  traditional sequential approach but is computationally more expensive and thus difficult
  to be applied to real-world manufacturing
