abstract: Wearables equipped with pervasive sensors enable us to monitor physiological
  and behavioral signals in our everyday life. We propose the WellAff system able
  to recognize affective states for wellbeing support. It also includes health care
  scenarios, in particular patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) suffering from
  bipolar disorders. For the need of a large-scale field study, we revised over 50
  off-the-shelf devices in terms of usefulness for emotion, stress, meditation, sleep,
  and physical activity recognition and analysis. Their
