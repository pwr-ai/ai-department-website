abstract: Seed selection is one of the key factors influencing information spread
  within networks. Whereas most solutions are based on single-stage seeding at the
  beginning of the process, performance increases when additional seeds are used.
  This enables the acquisition of knowledge about ongoing processes and activating
  new nodes for further influence maximisation. This paper describes an approach based
  on the Vote-Rank algorithm with dynamic rankings for sequential seed selection.
  The results prove the increased
