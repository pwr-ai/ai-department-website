abstract: The paper presents a method of word image segmentation into images of individual
  characters. The method is semi-automatic, because it requires that the character
  sequence constituting the word on the image is know. It is assumed that widths of
  the characters in the alphabet are random variables and that the parametres of probability
  distribution are specific for each character. At the first stage of the proposed
  method the parameters of the distributions for all alphabet characters are estimated.
  Then for each word in the corpus
