 abstract = {We present a direct method to construct a morpho-syntactic guesser for Polish. Such guesser produces morpho-syntactic descriptions for word forms unknown to the morphological analyser. The method relies upon a statistical a tergo index, in which pseudo-suffixes (endings) extracted from a statistical tree define morphosyntactic properties of corresponding word forms. The secondary aim is to investigate to what extent it is possible to develop the morphological analysis exclusively on the basis of endings. A statistically},
