abstract: We present a direct method to construct a morpho-syntactic guesser for Polish.
  Such guesser produces morpho-syntactic descriptions for word forms unknown to the
  morphological analyser. The method relies upon a statistical a tergo index, in which
  pseudo-suffixes (endings) extracted from a statistical tree define morphosyntactic
  properties of corresponding word forms. The secondary aim is to investigate to what
  extent it is possible to develop the morphological analysis exclusively on the basis
  of endings. A statistically
