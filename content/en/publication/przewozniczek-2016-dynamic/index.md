abstract: Coevolution is a well-known way of population diversity preservation in
  the field of Evolutionary Computation. Usually, the methods that use coevolution
  are effective in solving hard optimization problems, because they are less likely
  to stuck in local optima. Therefore, they are more capable of reaching a breakthrough,
  find new, promising regions in the solution search space and propose solutions of
  better quality. One of the main drawbacks of coevolution is the high computation
  cost of many coevolving subpopulations maintenance. If
