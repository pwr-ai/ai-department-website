 abstract = {Coevolution is a well-known way of population diversity preservation in the field of Evolutionary Computation. Usually, the methods that use coevolution are effective in solving hard optimization problems, because they are less likely to stuck in local optima. Therefore, they are more capable of reaching a breakthrough, find new, promising regions in the solution search space and propose solutions of better quality. One of the main drawbacks of coevolution is the high computation cost of many coevolving subpopulations maintenance. If},
