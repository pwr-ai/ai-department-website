abstract: 'We present an open dataset for evaluation and development of Polish Question
  Answering systems. It consists of 4721 question–answer pairs obtained from Czy wiesz
  (Do you know) Wikipedia project. Each question is answered with a pointer to a Wikipedia
  article. We argue that the dataset is well suited for evaluation of Open Domain
  Question Answering systems. We show this by performing evaluation of four methods
  of answer reranking using: Tf. Idf using base forms only, Tf. Idf extended with
  information from dependency analysis, Minimal'
