 abstract = {We present an open dataset for evaluation and development of Polish Question Answering systems. It consists of 4721 question–answer pairs obtained from Czy wiesz (Do you know) Wikipedia project. Each question is answered with a pointer to a Wikipedia article. We argue that the dataset is well suited for evaluation of Open Domain Question Answering systems. We show this by performing evaluation of four methods of answer reranking using: Tf. Idf using base forms only, Tf. Idf extended with information from dependency analysis, Minimal},
