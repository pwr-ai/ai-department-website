abstract: This paper presents a new approach to the graph coloring problem (GCP) which
  utilizes information about conflict localization in a given coloring. In this context
  a partial fitness function (pff) and its usage to specialize genetic operators and
  phenotypic measure of diversity in population are described. Particular attention
  is given to the investigation of the influence of the population size and the usage
  of genetic operators on the character of the evolution, especially influence leading
  to a premature convergence in the evolution process
