abstract: Since there have been a number of online social networking services (SNS),
  we have been experiencing new social phenomena around us. Traditional social network
  analysis methods [Gan and Zhu 2007, Jung 2010] might have difficulties efficiently
  understanding the large-scale social data from such SNS [Jung 2012]. Moreover, as
  the area of social networks is a highly cross-disciplinary one, we aim to foster
  and develop sustainable collaborations between Computer Science and Informatics,
  Sociology, Cognitive Science and Psychology
