 abstract = {Since there have been a number of online social networking services (SNS), we have been experiencing new social phenomena around us. Traditional social network analysis methods [Gan and Zhu 2007, Jung 2010] might have difficulties efficiently understanding the large-scale social data from such SNS [Jung 2012]. Moreover, as the area of social networks is a highly cross-disciplinary one, we aim to foster and develop sustainable collaborations between Computer Science and Informatics, Sociology, Cognitive Science and Psychology},
