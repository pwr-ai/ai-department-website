abstract: The social influence maximization problem is an important research topic
  for many years since it has a tremendous impact on society. As social influence
  can be maximized for many purposes, such as marketing, politics, spreading innovations,
  there are many stakeholders interested in progress in this area. As it has been
  shown, for most settings finding an optimal seed set is an NP-hard problem, this
  is why various heuristics started to emerge since the statement of the problem.
  In this work, we explore the applicability of evolutionary algorithm
