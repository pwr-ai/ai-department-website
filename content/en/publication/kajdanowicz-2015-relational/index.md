abstract: A novel approach to relational classification based on a Gaussian Random
  Field and random walks over the graph representing labeled and unlabeled examples
  is proposed in the paper. Additionally, a class homogeneity measure has been introduced.
  It can be used for pre-assessment of method applicability for particular networks.
  The presented experimental results on eight datasets revealed that the framework
  based on random walk concept possesses the promising potential to effectively classify
  nodes in the network
