 abstract = {Multilayer networks are the underlying structures of multiple real-world systems where we have more than one type of interaction/relation between nodes: social, biological, computer, or communication, to name only a few. In many cases, they are helpful in modeling processes that happen on top of them, which leads to gaining more knowledge about these phenomena. One example of such a process is the spread of influence. Here, the members of a social system spread the influence across the network by contacting each other, sharing},
