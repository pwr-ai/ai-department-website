abstract: 'Multilayer networks are the underlying structures of multiple real-world
  systems where we have more than one type of interaction/relation between nodes:
  social, biological, computer, or communication, to name only a few. In many cases,
  they are helpful in modeling processes that happen on top of them, which leads to
  gaining more knowledge about these phenomena. One example of such a process is the
  spread of influence. Here, the members of a social system spread the influence across
  the network by contacting each other, sharing'
