abstract: The present paper is devoted to the pattern recognition procedures that
  simultaneously use the information contained in the empirical data (learning set)
  and the set of expert rules with unprecisely formulated weights understood as conditional
  probabilities. Adopting the probabilistic model the combined and unified recognition
  algorithms are derived. In the first approach algorithm is based simply on the both
  set of data, in the second however, one set of data is transformed into the second
  one. Proposed algorithms were applied practically to
