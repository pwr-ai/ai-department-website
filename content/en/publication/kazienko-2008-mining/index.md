abstract: 'The new type of patterns: sequential patterns with the negative conclusions
  is proposed in the paper. They denote that a certain set of items does not occur
  after a regular frequent sequence. Some experimental results and the SPAWN algorithm
  for mining sequential patterns with the negative conclusions are also presented.'
