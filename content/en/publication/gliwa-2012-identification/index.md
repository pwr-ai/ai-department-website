abstract: The paper addresses a problem of change identification in social group evolution.
  A new SGCI method for discovering of stable groups was proposed and compared with
  existing GED method. The experimental studies on a Polish blogosphere service revealed
  that both methods are able to identify similar evolution events even though both
  use different concepts. Some differences were demonstrated as well.
