abstract: Exponentially growing network traffic is triggered by different services
  including cloud computing, Content Delivery Networks and other. To satisfy these
  needs, new network technologies like Elastic Optical Networks (EON) are proposed.
  The EONs bring new, hard optimization problems, like Routing and Spectrum Allocation
  problem considered in this paper. The well-known and common tools to solve the NP-hard
  problems are Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). A number of EA-based methods were proposed
  to solve the RSA problem
