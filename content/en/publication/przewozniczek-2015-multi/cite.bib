 abstract = {Exponentially growing network traffic is triggered by different services including cloud computing, Content Delivery Networks and other. To satisfy these needs, new network technologies like Elastic Optical Networks (EON) are proposed. The EONs bring new, hard optimization problems, like Routing and Spectrum Allocation problem considered in this paper. The well-known and common tools to solve the NP-hard problems are Evolutionary Algorithms (EA). A number of EA-based methods were proposed to solve the RSA problem},
