 abstract = {There are, eg, separate bases for parts of speech or semantic domains, represented by  the so-called lexicographers’ files. Registers have a major role to play in shaping the  structure of plWordNet. We will continue the practice of making registers figure in the  definitions of lexico-semantic relations, but we will analyse them, and introduce register  values into plWordNet, very systematically. To begin with, we need an appropriate set of  marking labels. It should streamline the description of lexico},
