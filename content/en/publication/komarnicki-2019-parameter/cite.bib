 abstract = {Limiting the number of required settings is an important part of any evolutionary method development. The final objective of this process is a method version that is parameter-less. Based on the research results presented that far, the leading methods in the combinatorial optimization are Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA), Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) and Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm II (DSMGA-II). P3 was originally proposed as a parameter-less method, while LTGA and DSMGA-II in their original},
