abstract: Limiting the number of required settings is an important part of any evolutionary
  method development. The final objective of this process is a method version that
  is parameter-less. Based on the research results presented that far, the leading
  methods in the combinatorial optimization are Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm (LTGA),
  Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) and Dependency Structure Matrix Genetic Algorithm
  II (DSMGA-II). P3 was originally proposed as a parameter-less method, while LTGA
  and DSMGA-II in their original
publication: '*Proceedings of the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference
  Companion*'
