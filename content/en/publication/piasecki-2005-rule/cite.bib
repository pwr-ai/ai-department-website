 abstract = {In the paper an approach to the construction of rule-based morphosyntactic tagger for Polish is proposed. The core of the tagger are modules of rules (classification systems), acquired from the IPI PAN corpus by application of Genetic Algorithms. Each module is specialised in making decisions concerning different parts of a tag (a structure of attributes). The acquired rules are combined with linguistic rules made by hand and memory-based rules acquired also from the corpus. The construction of the tagger and experiments concerning its},
