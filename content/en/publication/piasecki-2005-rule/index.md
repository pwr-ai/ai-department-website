abstract: In the paper an approach to the construction of rule-based morphosyntactic
  tagger for Polish is proposed. The core of the tagger are modules of rules (classification
  systems), acquired from the IPI PAN corpus by application of Genetic Algorithms.
  Each module is specialised in making decisions concerning different parts of a tag
  (a structure of attributes). The acquired rules are combined with linguistic rules
  made by hand and memory-based rules acquired also from the corpus. The construction
  of the tagger and experiments concerning its
