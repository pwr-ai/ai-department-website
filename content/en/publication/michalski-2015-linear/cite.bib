 abstract = {The problem of finding optimal set of users for influencing others in social networks has been studied for more than ten years. As it has been shown, it is a NP-hard problem, so since than some heuristics were proposed as suboptimal solutions. Still, one of the commonly used assumption is the one that seeds are chosen on the static network, not the temporal one. This static approach is in fact far from the real-world networks, where new nodes may appear and old ones dynamically disappear in course of time. An alternative and},
