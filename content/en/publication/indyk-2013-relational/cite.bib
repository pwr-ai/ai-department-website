 abstract = {The problem of automated video categorization in large datasets is considered in the paper. A new Iterative Multi-label Propagation (IMP) algorithm for relational learning in multi-label data is proposed. Based on the information of the already categorized videos and their relations to other videos, the system assigns suitable categoriesâ€”multiple labels to the unknown videos. The MapReduce approach to the IMP algorithm described in the paper enables processing of large datasets in parallel computing. The experiments carried out on},
