abstract: The problem of automated video categorization in large datasets is considered
  in the paper. A new Iterative Multi-label Propagation (IMP) algorithm for relational
  learning in multi-label data is proposed. Based on the information of the already
  categorized videos and their relations to other videos, the system assigns suitable
  categoriesâ€”multiple labels to the unknown videos. The MapReduce approach to the
  IMP algorithm described in the paper enables processing of large datasets in parallel
  computing. The experiments carried out on
