abstract: The paper presents methods applied in the construction of a bi-directional
  Polish-English machine translation system. Since the system was created as a wide-scale
  commercial product, such aspects as speed of translation, ungrammatical texts and
  time and cost of developing the system are of great importance. An attempt of solving
  these problems by use of Machine Learning techniques in parsing and tagging is discussed.
