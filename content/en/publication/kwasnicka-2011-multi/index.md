abstract: One of the main evolutionary algorithms bottlenecks is the significant effectiveness
  dropdown caused by increasing number of genes necessary for coding the problem solution.
  In this paper, we present a multi population pattern searching algorithm (MuPPetS),
  which is supposed to be an answer to situations where long coded individuals are
  a must. MuPPetS uses some of the messy GA ideas like coding and operators. The presented
  algorithm uses the binary coding, however the objective is to use MuPPetS against
  real-life
