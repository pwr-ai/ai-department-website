abstract: The following chapter aims to present the current research in the area of
  modelling and maximizing social influence in networks. Apart from describing the
  most popular models for this process, it focuses on presenting the advances in maximizing
  the spread of influence in social networks. Since most of the research was suited
  for static networks case, nowadays it is necessary to move it toward the networks
  that are everywhere around us—the dynamic ones. As is widely agreed in the scientific
  community, static networks are unacceptable
