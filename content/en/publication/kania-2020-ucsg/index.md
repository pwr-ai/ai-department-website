abstract: Signed distance field (SDF) is a prominent implicit representation of 3D
  meshes. Methods that are based on such representation achieved state-of-the-art
  3D shape reconstruction quality. However, these methods struggle to reconstruct
  non-convex shapes. One remedy is to incorporate a constructive solid geometry framework
  (CSG) that represents a shape as a decomposition into primitives. It allows to embody
  a 3D shape of high complexity and non-convexity with a simple tree representation
  of Boolean operations. Nevertheless, existing
