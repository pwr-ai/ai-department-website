abstract: Multi-label classification, in opposite to conventional classification,
  assumes that each data instance may be associated with more than one labels simultaneously.
  Multi-label learning methods take advantage of dependencies between labels, but
  this implies greater learning computational complexity. The paper considers Classifier
  Chain multi-label classification method, which in original form is fast, but assumes
  the order of labels in the chain. This leads to propagation of inference errors
  down the chain. On the other hand recent Bayes
