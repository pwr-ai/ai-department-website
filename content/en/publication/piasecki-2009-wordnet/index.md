abstract: The WordNet Weaver application supports extension of a new wordnet. One
  of its functions is to suggest lexical units semantically close to a given unit.
  Suggestions arise from activation-area attachment–multi-criteria voting based on
  several algorithms that score semantic relatedness. We present the contributing
  algorithms and the method of combining them. Starting from a manually constructed
  core wordnet and a list of over 1000 units to add, we observed a linguist at work.
