abstract: The challenge of influence maximization in social networks is tackled in
  many settings and scenarios. However, the most explored variant is looking at how
  to choose a seed set of a given size, that maximizes the number of activated nodes
  for selected model of social influence. This has been studied mostly in the area
  of static networks, yet other kinds of networks, such as multilayer or temporal
  ones, are also in the scope of recent research. In this work we propose and evaluate
  the measure based on entropy, that investigates how the
