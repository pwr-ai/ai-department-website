abstract: Information spreading in complex networks is often modeled as diffusing
  information with certain probability from nodes that possess it to their neighbors
  that do not. Information cascades are triggered when the activation of a set of
  initial nodes–seeds–results in diffusion to large number of nodes. Here, several
  novel approaches for seed initiation that replace the commonly used activation of
  all seeds at once with a sequence of initiation stages are introduced. Sequential
  strategies at later stages avoid seeding highly
