abstract: The concept of new approach for debt portfolio pattern recognition is presented
  in the paper. Aggregated prediction of sequential repayment values over time for
  a set of claims is performed by means of hybrid combination of various machine learning
  techniques, including clustering of references, model selection and enrichment of
  input variables with prediction outputs from preceding periods. Experimental studies
  on real data revealed usefulness of the proposed approach for claim appraisals.
  The average accuracy was over
