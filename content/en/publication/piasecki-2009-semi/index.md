abstract: The WordNet Weaver is an application which offers comprehensive support
  to the creators of a new wordnet. One of its functions is to suggest lexical units
  semantically close to a given unit. Suggestions result from multi-criteria voting
  based on several algorithms that produce semantic relatedness scores. We present
  the contributing algorithms and the method of combining them. Starting from a manually
  constructed core wordnet and a list of over 1000 units to add, we observed a linguist
  at work. The results are analysed and
