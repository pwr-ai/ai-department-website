 abstract = {In this paper two level model of handwritten word recognition is considered. On the first level the consecutive letters are recognized by the same classifier using preprocessed data from the optical device, while on the second level we try to recognize the whole word. From the other point of view we can treat the first level as a feature reduction level. Then, in this paper two different methods of feature reduction for handwritten word recognition algorithm are described. On the lower level different well-known in the literature methods are taken into},
