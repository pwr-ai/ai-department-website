abstract: In this paper two level model of handwritten word recognition is considered.
  On the first level the consecutive letters are recognized by the same classifier
  using preprocessed data from the optical device, while on the second level we try
  to recognize the whole word. From the other point of view we can treat the first
  level as a feature reduction level. Then, in this paper two different methods of
  feature reduction for handwritten word recognition algorithm are described. On the
  lower level different well-known in the literature methods are taken into
