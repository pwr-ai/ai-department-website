abstract: Ensemble methods of incremental prediction for sequences refer to learning
  from new reference data that become available after the model has already been created
  from a previously available data set. The main obstacle in the prediction of sequential
  values in the real environment with huge amount of data is the integration of knowledge
  stored in the previously obtained models and the new knowledge derived from the
  incrementally acquired new increases of the data. In the paper, the new approach
  of the ensemble
