abstract: The major objective of this paper is to deploy an effective evolutionary
  algorithm (EA) for the congestion problem in connection-oriented networks. The network
  flow is modeled as non-bifurcated multicommodity flow. The main novelty of this
  work is that the proposed evolutionary algorithm consists of two levels. The high
  level applies typical EA operators. The low level idea is based on the hierarchical
  algorithm idea. However, the presented approach is not a classical hierarchical
  algorithm. Therefore, we call the algorithm quasi
