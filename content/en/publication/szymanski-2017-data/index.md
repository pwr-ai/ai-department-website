abstract: 'We study the performance of data-driven, a priori and random approaches
  to label space partitioning for multi-label classification with a Gaussian Naive
  Bayes classifier. Experiments were performed on 12 benchmark data sets and evaluated
  on 5 established measures of classification quality: micro and macro averaged F1
  score, subset accuracy and Hamming loss. Data-driven methods are significantly better
  than an average run of the random baseline. In case of F1 scores and Subset Accuracy-data
  driven approaches were more'
