abstract: Machine learning and data mining algorithms usually assume that the training
  and future data have the same distribution and come from the same feature space.
  However, in majority of real-world problems, this is not true. In case of Debt portfolio
  appraisal we have sufficient training data only in another domain of interest, namely
  in other portfolios. Therefore, only knowledge transfer from these portfolios in
  inference for new one is possible. In the paper we propose transfer learning and
  learning based on similarity methods, basing
