abstract: A framework for recommendation of multimedia objects based on processing
  of individual ontologies is proposed in the chapter. The recommendation process
  takes into account similarities calculated both between objects' and users' ontologies,
  which reflect the social and semantic features existing in the system. The ontologies,
  which are close to the current context, provide a list of suggestions presented
  to the user. Each user in the system possesses its own Personal Agent that performs
  all necessary online tasks. Personal Agents
