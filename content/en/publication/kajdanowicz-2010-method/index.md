abstract: The paper describes the process and new methodology of a hybrid prediction
  system for business sequential data ie debt portfolio appraisal. Conducting the
  local area competence data mining approach, repayment values are predicted by means
  of combination of various data mining techniques. The methods include clustering
  of references, model selection and enrichment of input variables with prediction
  outputs from preceding periods. Experimental studies concern the method's configuration
  influence on its general performance such as
