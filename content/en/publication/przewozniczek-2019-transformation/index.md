abstract: Evolutionary methods are well-known tools used for solving hard computational
  problems. In this paper, we consider k-Shortest Steiner Trees (kSST) problem appearing
  in a diverse set of domains, eg, multicast tree construction in communication networks
  in general, and optical networks in particular. The kSST is relatively new and has
  not been widely investigated in the literature. Thus, only a few algorithms have
  been proposed, each requiring significant resources amount and long execution times,
  partially following from the
publication: '*Information Sciences*'
