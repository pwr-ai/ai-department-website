 abstract = {More and more large data collections are gathered worldwide in various IT systems. Many of them possess a networked nature and need to be processed and analysed as graph structures. Due to their size they very often require the usage of a parallel paradigm for efficient computation. Three parallel techniques have been compared in the paper: MapReduce, its map-side join extension and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP). They are implemented for two different graph problems: calculation of single source shortest paths},
