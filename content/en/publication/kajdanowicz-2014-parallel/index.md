abstract: 'More and more large data collections are gathered worldwide in various
  IT systems. Many of them possess a networked nature and need to be processed and
  analysed as graph structures. Due to their size they very often require the usage
  of a parallel paradigm for efficient computation. Three parallel techniques have
  been compared in the paper: MapReduce, its map-side join extension and Bulk Synchronous
  Parallel (BSP). They are implemented for two different graph problems: calculation
  of single source shortest paths'
