abstract: The paper focuses on selecting an optimal set of the Multiword Expressions
  Extraction methods used as a tool during wordnet expansion. Wordnet multiword lexical
  units are a broad class and it is difficult to find a single extraction method fulfilling
  the task. Many extraction association measures were tested on very large corpora
  and a very large wordnet, namely plWordNet. Several new measures are proposed and
  compared with selected methods in the literature. Two ways of combining measures
  into ensembles were
