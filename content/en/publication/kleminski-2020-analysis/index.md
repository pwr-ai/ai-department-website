abstract: In our study, we examine the impact of citation network structures on the
  ability to discern valuable research topics in Computer Science literature. We use
  the bibliographic information available in the DBLP database to extract candidate
  phrases from scientific paper abstracts. Following that, we construct citation networks
  based on direct citation, co-citation and bibliographic coupling relationships between
  the papers. The candidate research topics, in the form of keyphrases and n-grammes,
  are subsequently ranked and
publication: '*Journal of Information Science*'
