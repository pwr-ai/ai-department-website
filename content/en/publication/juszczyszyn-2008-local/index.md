abstract: Network motifs–small subgraphs that reflect local topology can be used to
  discover general profile and properties of the network. Analysis of motifs for the
  large social networks derived from email communication is presented in the paper.
  The distribution of motifs in all analyzed real social networks is very similar
  one another and can be treated as the network fingerprint. This property is most
  distinctive for stronger human relationships.
