abstract: 'In the paper the multilevel probabilistic approach to hand printed form
  recognition is described. The form recognition is decomposed into two levels: character
  recognition and word recognition. On the letter level the rough sets approach is
  presented. After this level of classification, for every position in the word, we
  obtain either the certain or the subset of possible or the subset of impossible
  decision about recognized letter. After on the word level the probabilistic lexicons
  are available. The decision on the word level is performed using'
