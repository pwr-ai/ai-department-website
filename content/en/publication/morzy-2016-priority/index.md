abstract: Currently available artificial network generation models are characterized
  by consistency and low variance due to the rigidity of models' underlying assumptions.
  Networks generated from these models are usually too regular and do not contain
  noise and imbalance inherent in networks induced by human behavior. An important
  consequence is that much research on social network analysis presented in recent
  years used idealistic artificial networks that did not conform to reality. In order
  to alleviate this problem we introduce a new network
