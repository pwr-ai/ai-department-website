abstract: To further extend the applicability of wearable sensors in various domains
  such as mobile health systems and the automotive industry, new methods for accurately
  extracting subtle physiological information from these wearable sensors are required.
  However, the extraction of valuable information from physiological signals is still
  challenging—smartphones can count steps and compute heart rate, but they cannot
  recognize emotions and related affective states. This study analyzes the possibility
  of using end-to-end multimodal deep
