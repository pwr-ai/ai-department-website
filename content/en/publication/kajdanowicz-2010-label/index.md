abstract: 'A new method of feature extraction in the social network for within-network
  classification is proposed in the paper. The method provides new features calculated
  by combination of both: network structure information and class labels assigned
  to nodes. The influence of various features on classification performance has also
  been studied. The experiments on real-world data have shown that features created
  owing to the proposed method can lead to significant improvement of classification
  accuracy.'
