abstract: 'This paper presents methods solving MS-RCPSP as a main task-resource-time
  assignment optimization problem. In the paper there are presented four variants
  of Evolutionary Algorithm applied to MS-RCPSP problem: concerning prioritization
  the tasks (or resources), combined task-resources prioritizing approach and co-evolution
  based approach that effectively solves problem dividing it to two subproblems. All
  approaches are examined using benchmark MS-RCPSP iMOPSE dataset and results show
  that the problem'
