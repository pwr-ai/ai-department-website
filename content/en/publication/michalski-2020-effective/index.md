abstract: The spread of influence in networks is a topic of great importance in many
  application areas. For instance, one would like to maximise the coverage, limiting
  the budget for marketing campaign initialisation and use the potential of social
  influence. To tackle this and similar challenges, more than a decade ago, researchers
  started to investigate the influence maximisation problem. The challenge is to find
  the best set of initially activated seed nodes in order to maximise the influence
  spread in networks. In typical approach we will activate all
