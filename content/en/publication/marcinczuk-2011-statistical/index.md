abstract: EN In the paper we present a Proper Name Recognition algorithm based on
  the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Recognition of the Proper Names (PN) is treated as
  the basis for Named Entity Recognition problem in general. The proposed method is
  based on combining domain-dependent method based on HMM with domain independent
  methods based on gazetteers and hand-written rules for recognition and post-processing
  that capture the general properties of Polish PN structure. A large gazetteer with
  entries described
