abstract: A word-to-word similarity function automatically extracted from a corpus
  of texts can be a very helpful tool in automatic extraction of lexical semantic
  relations. There are many approaches for English, but only a few for inflective
  languages with almost free word order. In the paper a method for the construction
  of a similarity function for Polish nouns is proposed. The method uses only simple
  tools for language processing (eg it does need the application of a parser). The
  core is the construction of a matrix of co-occurrences of nouns
