abstract: Seeding strategies for influence maximization in social networks have been
  studied for more than a decade. They have mainly relied on the activation of all
  resources (seeds) simultaneously in the beginning; yet, it has been shown that sequential
  seeding strategies are commonly better. This research focuses on studying sequential
  seeding with buffering, which is an extension to basic sequential seeding concept.
  The proposed method avoids choosing nodes that will be activated through the natural
  diffusion process, which is leading
