abstract: The paper presents the latest release of the Polish WordNet, namely plWordNet
  4.1. The most significant developments since 3.0 version include new relations for
  nouns and verbs, mapping semantic role-relations from the valency lexicon Walenty
  onto the plWordNet structure and sense-level inter-lingual mapping. Several statistics
  are presented in order to illustrate the development and contemporary state of the
  wordnet.
