abstract: 'We present a method for the structural collocation extraction for an inflective
  language (Polish) based on the process divided into two phases: 1. extraction and
  filtering of the pairs of lemmatised wordforms and 2. structural annotation of the
  extracted collocations with lexico-syntactic patterns. The pattern templates and
  parameters are specified manually but their instances are both generated and tested
  on the corpus automatically. The extracted collocations were evaluated by applying
  them as rules in morphosyntactic disambiguation of'
