abstract: In smart factories, integrated optimisation of manufacturing process planning
  and scheduling leads to better results than a traditional sequential approach but
  is computationally more expensive and thus difficult to be applied to real-world
  manufacturing scenarios. In this paper, a working approach for cloud-based distributed
  optimisation for process planning and scheduling is presented. Three managers dynamically
  governing the creation and deletion of subpopulations (islands) evolved by a multi-objective
  genetic algorithm are
