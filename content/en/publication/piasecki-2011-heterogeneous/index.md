abstract: The paper presents an algorithm of automatic wordnet expansion on the basis
  of heterogeneous knowledge sources extracted from a large corpus. The algorithm
  is the reformulation of the algorithm used in the WordnetWeaver system in terms
  of the SOM model. Integration of knowledge sources is based on the weighted voting
  scheme. Several wordnet relations are explored to define attachment points for a
  new word. Influence of different knowledge sources on the algorithm performance
  was experimentally investigated
