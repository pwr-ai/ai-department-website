abstract: 'The paper examines two approaches to sentiment analysis: lexicon-based
  vs. supervised learning in the domain of movie reviews. In evaluation, the methods
  were compared using a standard movie review test collection. The results show that
  lexicon-based approach is easily outperformed by classification approach. Â© 2014
