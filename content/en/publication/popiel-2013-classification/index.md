abstract: The main goal of the paper is to propose a classification method for differential
  diagnosis in primary care domain. Commonly, the final diagnosis for the episode
  of care is related with the initial reason for encounter (RfE). However, many distinct
  diagnoses can follow from a single RfE and they need to be distinguished. The new
  method exploits the data about whole episodes of care quantified by individual patients'
  encounters and it extracts episode features from electronic health record to learn
  the classifier. The experimental studies
