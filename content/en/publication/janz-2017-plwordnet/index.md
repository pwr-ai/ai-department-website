abstract: 'We present a large emotive lexicon of Polish which has been constructed
  by manual expansion of the emotive annotation defined for plWordNet 3.0 emo (a very
  large wordnet of Polish). The annotation encompasses: sentiment polarity, basic
  emotions and fundamental human values. Annotation scheme and revised guidelines
  for the annotation process are discussed. We present also statistics for the contemporary
  state of the development. Finally, the idea of the second plWordNet-based emotive
  lexicon created in controlled experiments'
