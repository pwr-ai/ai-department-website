abstract: This article investigates the possibility of accurate quality prediction
  of resources generated by communities based on the crowd-generated content. We use
  data from Wikipedia, the prime example of community-run site, as our object of study.
  We define the quality as a distribution of user-assigned grades across a predefined
  range of possible scores and present a measure of distribution similarity to quantify
  the accuracy of a prediction. The proposed method of quality prediction is based
  on Markov Random Field and its Loopy
