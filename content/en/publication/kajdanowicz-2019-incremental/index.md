abstract: Prediction over edges and nodes in graphs requires appropriate and efficiently
  achieved data representation. Recent research on representation learning for dynamic
  networks resulted in a significant progress. However, the more precise and accurate
  methods, the greater computational and memory complexity. Here, we introduce ICMENâ€“the
  first-in-class incremental meta-embedding method that produces vector representations
  of nodes respecting temporal dependencies in the graph. ICMEN efficiently constructs
  nodes'
