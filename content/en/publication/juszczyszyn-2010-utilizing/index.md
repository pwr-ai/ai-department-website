abstract: We present a method that utilises dynamic molecular modelling technique
  to track the changes within complex social network. The users forming a social network
  are interpreted as large sets of interacting particles. The data for the conducted
  research was obtained from e-mail communication within Enron company. The social
  network of employees was extracted and used to evaluate the methodology of social
  network dynamics modelling.
