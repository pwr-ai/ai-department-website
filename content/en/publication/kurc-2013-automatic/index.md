abstract: Proper names outnumber all other word classes, but they are underrepresented
  in dictionaries and in electronic resources. We propose an automatic method of associating
  a stand-alone proper name repository with a wordnet. A variety of sources of lexical-semantic
  knowledge can be harnessed into this task. Semantic proximity between a proper name
  and a synset can be based on pattern-driven search and on distributional analyses
  in large corpora. The sources are heterogeneous and the measures of semantic relatedness
  vary
