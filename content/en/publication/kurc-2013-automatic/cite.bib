 abstract = {Proper names outnumber all other word classes, but they are underrepresented in dictionaries and in electronic resources. We propose an automatic method of associating a stand-alone proper name repository with a wordnet. A variety of sources of lexical-semantic knowledge can be harnessed into this task. Semantic proximity between a proper name and a synset can be based on pattern-driven search and on distributional analyses in large corpora. The sources are heterogeneous and the measures of semantic relatedness vary},
