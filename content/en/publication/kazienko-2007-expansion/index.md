abstract: 'A social network, in which nodes represent humans and weighted ties reflect
  relationships between them, can be formed in an automatic way based on the data
  about customers of a telecommunication company as well as their communication activities.
  The expansion of a telecommunication social network can be supported with one of
  three main approaches that have been considered in this paper: existing group conjunction,
  internal expansion of groups, and transfer of external relationships.'
