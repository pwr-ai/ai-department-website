 abstract = {A social network, in which nodes represent humans and weighted ties reflect relationships between them, can be formed in an automatic way based on the data about customers of a telecommunication company as well as their communication activities. The expansion of a telecommunication social network can be supported with one of three main approaches that have been considered in this paper: existing group conjunction, internal expansion of groups, and transfer of external relationships.},
