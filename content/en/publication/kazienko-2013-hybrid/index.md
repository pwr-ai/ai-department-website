abstract: Hybrid and ensemble methods in machine learning have attracted a great attention
  of the scientific community over the last years [Zhou, 12]. Multiple, ensemble learning
  models have been theoretically and empirically shown to provide significantly better
  performance than single weak learners, especially while dealing with high dimensional,
  complex regression and classification problems [Brazdil, 09],[Okun, 08]. Adaptive
  hybrid systems has become essential in computational intelligence and soft computing,
  as being able to deal with
