abstract: The large tagset of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish enforced a modular architecture
  of the Polish tagger called TaKIPI. The architecture introduce several parameters,
  for learning and tagging, that are difficult to be properly adjusted manually. In
  this paper a method of optimisation of the parameters values based on Genetic Algorithm
  is presented. A chromosome is a set of values, a specimen is a tagger together with
  the learning process, and the fitness function is a test of the tagger's accuracy.
  The optimisation process is
