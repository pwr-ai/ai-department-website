 abstract = {The large tagset of the IPI PAN Corpus of Polish enforced a modular architecture of the Polish tagger called TaKIPI. The architecture introduce several parameters, for learning and tagging, that are difficult to be properly adjusted manually. In this paper a method of optimisation of the parameters values based on Genetic Algorithm is presented. A chromosome is a set of values, a specimen is a tagger together with the learning process, and the fitness function is a test of the tagger's accuracy. The optimisation process is},
