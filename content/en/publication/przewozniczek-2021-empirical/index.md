abstract: In this paper, we consider an NP-hard, real-world optimization problem from
  the field of computer networks. The problem refers to the network survivability
  and may be considered hard due to its scale. Such problems are usually successfully
  solved by various Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The recent advances in the development
  of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) dedicated to solving discrete-encoded problems
  show that GAs employing modern linkage learning techniques seem to have exceptional
  potential in proposing high-quality results
