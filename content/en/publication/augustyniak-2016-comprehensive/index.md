abstract: We propose a novel method for counting sentiment orientation that outperforms
  supervised learning approaches in time and memory complexity and is not statistically
  significantly different from them in accuracy. Our method consists of a novel approach
  to generating unigram, bigram and trigram lexicons. The proposed method, called
  frequentiment, is based on calculating the frequency of features (words) in the
  document and averaging their impact on the sentiment score as opposed to documents
  that do not contain these features
