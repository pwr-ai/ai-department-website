abstract: We consider here information spread which propagates with certain probability
  from nodes just activated to their not yet activated neighbors. Diffusion cascades
  can be triggered by activation of even a small set of nodes. Such activation is
  commonly performed in a single stage. A novel approach based on sequential seeding
  is analyzed here resulting in three fundamental contributions. First, we propose
  a coordinated execution of randomized choices to enable precise comparison of different
  algorithms in general. We apply it here when the
