 abstract = {We propose a novel approach to generate aspect hierarchies that proved to be consistently correct compared with human-generated hierarchies. We present an unsupervised technique using Rhetorical Structure Theory and graph analysis. We evaluated our approach based on 100,000 reviews from Amazon and achieved an astonishing 80% coverage compared with human-generated hierarchies coded in ConceptNet. The method could be easily extended with a sentiment analysis model and used to describe sentiment},
