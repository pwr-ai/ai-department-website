abstract: We propose a novel approach to generate aspect hierarchies that proved to
  be consistently correct compared with human-generated hierarchies. We present an
  unsupervised technique using Rhetorical Structure Theory and graph analysis. We
  evaluated our approach based on 100,000 reviews from Amazon and achieved an astonishing
  80% coverage compared with human-generated hierarchies coded in ConceptNet. The
  method could be easily extended with a sentiment analysis model and used to describe
  sentiment
