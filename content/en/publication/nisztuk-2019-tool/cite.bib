 abstract = {The paper presents the ELISi multi-criteria optimisation application for AFPG based on Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA). The research aims to create functional computational design tool for architects, mimicking the workflow of architectural design process. The article includes explanation of the proposed approach: problem representation, genetic algorithm operators, fitness functions definitions, post processing operations, software functionalities and workflow as well as achieved architectural results and outline of future research.},
