abstract: 'The paper presents the ELISi multi-criteria optimisation application for
  AFPG based on Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm (HEA). The research aims to create functional
  computational design tool for architects, mimicking the workflow of architectural
  design process. The article includes explanation of the proposed approach: problem
  representation, genetic algorithm operators, fitness functions definitions, post
  processing operations, software functionalities and workflow as well as achieved
  architectural results and outline of future research.'
