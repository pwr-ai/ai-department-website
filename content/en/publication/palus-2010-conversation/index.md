abstract: Email server logs contain records of all email Exchange through this server.
  Often we would like to analyze those emails not separately but in conversation thread,
  especially when we need to analyze social network extracted from those email logs.
  Unfortunately each mail is in different record and those record are not tided to
  each other in any obvious way. In this paper method for discussion threads extraction
  was proposed together with experiments on two different data setsâ€“Enron and WrUT..
