abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are frequently used to solve various practical
  problems. It is common to adjust an EA to the solved problem by adding a different
  kind of problem-dependent mechanisms. One of the possible improvements is an evolutionary
  method hybridization with local search algorithms. Such hybridization may lead to
  phenomena called the Baldwin effect. It was shown that the occurrence of Baldwin
  effect helps to preserve population diversity and therefore may be beneficial for
  the method
