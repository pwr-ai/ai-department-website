abstract: The collective classification problem for big data sets using MapReduce
  programming model was considered in the paper. We introduced a proposal for implementation
  of label propagation algorithm in the network. The method was examined on real dataset
  in telecommunication domain. The results indicated that it can be used to classify
  nodes in order to propose new offerings or tariffs to customers.
