abstract: A comparative study over six learning scenarios in debt pattern recognition
  is presented in the paper. There are proposed new approaches for distance measure
  definitions in training set selection. Using those measures for training set selection
  the inference models are trained using distinct reference. All proposed approaches
  are examined in dataset selection during prediction of debt portfolio value. Finally,
  basic evaluation on prediction performance is conducted.
