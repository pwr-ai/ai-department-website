abstract: The Object Oriented Analysis and Design Methodologies (OOADMs) have been
  developed for many years and with the emergence of Unified Modelling Language (UML)
  they are now becoming a matured standard for computer systems development. Advanced
  tools supporting integrated analysis, designing and development of computer systems
  are appearing in parallel. Most of them allow easy integration with Graphical User
  Interface (GUI) and impose object oriented (OO) construction of User Interface (UI).
