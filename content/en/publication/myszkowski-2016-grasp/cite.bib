 abstract = {The paper describes an application of Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) in solving Multi–Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP). Proposed work proposes a specific greedy–based local search and schedule constructor specialised to MS-RCPSP. The GRASP is presented as the better option to classical heuristic but also as a faster and successful alternative to another metaheuristic. To compare results of GRASP to others approaches, various methods are proposed: methods},
