abstract: 'A Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial problem
  that is very important for many real-world applications. In this paper, it is shown,
  that proposed approach solves multi-objective TSP (mTSP) more effectively than other
  investigated methods, ie, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II).
  The proposed methods use rank and crowding distance (well-known from NSGA-II), combining
  those mechanisms in a novel, unique way: competing and co-evolving in the evolution
  process. The proposed'
