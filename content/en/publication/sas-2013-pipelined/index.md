abstract: The aim of works described in this article is to elaborate and experimentally
  evaluate a consistent method of Language Model (LM) construction for the sake of
  Polish speech recognition. In the proposed method we tried to take into account
  the features and specific problems experienced in practical applications of speech
  recognition in the Polish language, reach inflection, a loose word order and the
  tendency for short word deletion. The LM is created in five stages. Each successive
  stage takes the model prepared at the
publication: '*International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science*'
