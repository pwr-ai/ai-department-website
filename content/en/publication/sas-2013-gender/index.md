abstract: The paper presents the simple technique of speaker gender recognition that
  uses MFCC features typically applied in automatic speech recognition. Artificial
  neural network is used as a classifier. The speech signal is first divided into
  20 ms frames. For each frame, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are extracted
  and the created feature vector is provided into a neural network classifier, which
  individually classifies each frame as male or female sample. Finally, the whole
  utterance is classified by selecting the class, for which the sum of
