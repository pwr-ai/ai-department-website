 abstract = {The paper presents the simple technique of speaker gender recognition that uses MFCC features typically applied in automatic speech recognition. Artificial neural network is used as a classifier. The speech signal is first divided into 20 ms frames. For each frame, Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients are extracted and the created feature vector is provided into a neural network classifier, which individually classifies each frame as male or female sample. Finally, the whole utterance is classified by selecting the class, for which the sum of},
