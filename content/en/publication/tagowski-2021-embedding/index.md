abstract: In recent years, dynamic graph embedding has attracted a lot of attention
  due to its usefulness in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider discrete-time
  dynamic graph representation learning, where embeddings are computed for each time
  window, and then are aggregated to represent the dynamics of a graph. However, independently
  computed embeddings in consecutive windows suffer from the stochastic nature of
  representation learning algorithms and are algebraically incomparable. We underline
  the need for
