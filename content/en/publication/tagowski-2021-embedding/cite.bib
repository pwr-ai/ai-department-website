 abstract = {In recent years, dynamic graph embedding has attracted a lot of attention due to its usefulness in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider discrete-time dynamic graph representation learning, where embeddings are computed for each time window, and then are aggregated to represent the dynamics of a graph. However, independently computed embeddings in consecutive windows suffer from the stochastic nature of representation learning algorithms and are algebraically incomparable. We underline the need for},
