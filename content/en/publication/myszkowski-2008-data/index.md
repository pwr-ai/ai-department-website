abstract: The paper presents e-learning an system as a source of large datasets that
  can be analyzed by data mining techniques. Proposed data mining techniques can be
  used as a didactic content recommendation system, feedback tool, intrusion detection
  tools etc. All techniques are applied to make learning process more effective (taking
  into account time consuming aspects and resource usage). The paper describes data
  mining tasks and techniques that can be applied to CelGrid system. A particular
  attention is given to the active learning
