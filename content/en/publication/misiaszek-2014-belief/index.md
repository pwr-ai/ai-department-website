abstract: The main goal of the paper is to present that word's sentiment can be discovered
  from propagation through well-defined word networks such as Word–Net. Therefore
  a new method for propagation of sentiment from a given word seed-Micro-WNOp corpus
  over the word network (WordNet 3.0) has been proposed and evaluated. The experimental
  studies proved that WordNet has a great potential in sentiment propagation, even
  if types of links (eg hyponymy, heteronymy etc.) and semantic meaning of words are
  not taken into
