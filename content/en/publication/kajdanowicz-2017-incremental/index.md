abstract: An incremental learning method for nodes’ classification is presented in the paper. In particular, there is proposed an active scheme algorithm for multi-class classification of nodes’ states that varies over time and depends on information spread in the network. Demonstration of the method is conducted using social network dataset. According to sent messages between nodes, the emotional state of the message sender updates each receiving node’s feature vector and the method tries to classify next emotional state of the receiver. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in applying incremental learning method for non-stationary network environment. There are demonstrated some properties of the proposed method in experiments with real data set, showing that the method can effectively classify the future state of nodes.
