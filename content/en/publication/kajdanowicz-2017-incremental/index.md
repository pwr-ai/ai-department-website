abstract: An incremental learning method for nodes' classification is presented in
  the paper. In particular, there is proposed an active scheme algorithm for multi-class
  classification of nodes' states that varies over time and depends on information
  spread in the network. Demonstration of the method is conducted using social network
  dataset. According to sent messages between nodes, the emotional state of the message
  sender updates each receiving node's feature vector and the method tries to classify
  next emotional state of the
