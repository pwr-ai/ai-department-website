abstract: A Polish WordNet has been under construction for two years. We discuss the
  organisation of the project, the fundamental assumptions, the tools and the resources.
  We show how our work differs from that done on EuroWordNet and BalkaNet. In a year
  we expect the network to reach 20000 lexical units. Some 12000 entries will have
  been completed by hand. Work on others will be automated as far as possible; to
  that end, we have developed statistics-based semantic similarity functions and methods
  based on a form of chunking. The
