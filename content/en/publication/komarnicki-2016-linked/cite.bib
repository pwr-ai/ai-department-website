 abstract = {Island Models (IMs) divide the whole population into many coevolving subpopulations, which periodically exchange fractions of their individuals. Some IMs, exchange probabilistic models built during the subpopulations evolution. The use of many coevolving subpopulations helps to preserve the population diversity, which makes it less likely to get stuck in the local optima. Another promising research direction in the Evolutionary Computation field is the Linkage Learning. The knowledge about gene dependencies can},
