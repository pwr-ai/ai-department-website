abstract: Island Models (IMs) divide the whole population into many coevolving subpopulations,
  which periodically exchange fractions of their individuals. Some IMs, exchange probabilistic
  models built during the subpopulations evolution. The use of many coevolving subpopulations
  helps to preserve the population diversity, which makes it less likely to get stuck
  in the local optima. Another promising research direction in the Evolutionary Computation
  field is the Linkage Learning. The knowledge about gene dependencies can
