abstract: In the field of Evolutionary Computation, the main objective is to find
  a high-quality solution to the considered problem. However, the other important
  issue is to find a solution efficiently. Therefore, evolutionary methods use various
  techniques to adjust to the problem and reduce the amount of resources consumed
  during an optimization process. One of the well-known and relatively simple techniques
  is storing the already evaluated genotypes and their ratings. Whenever an evolutionary
  method is to evaluate the fitness for a genotype that was
