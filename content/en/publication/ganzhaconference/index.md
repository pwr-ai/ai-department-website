abstract: Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) is considered an effective approach
  for conducting simulation studies in many fields. In order to develop high quality
  simulation models, methodological approaches are demanded. In such direction we
  are moving by proposing a heuristic for the formalization of agent based simulation
  problems. The proposed heuristic is based on some guidelines developed for identifying
  the main elements of the problem domain description by analysing verbs and their
  common taxonomy in
