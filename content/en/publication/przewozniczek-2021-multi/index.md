abstract: Evolutionary methods are effective tools for obtaining high-quality results
  when solving hard practical problems. Linkage learning may increase their effectiveness.
  One of the state-of-the-art methods that employ linkage learning is the Parameter-less
  Population Pyramid (P3). P3 is dedicated to solving single-objective problems in
  discrete domains. Recent research shows that P3 is highly competitive when addressing
  problems with so-called overlapping blocks, which are typical for practical problems.
  In this paper, we consider a multi-objective
