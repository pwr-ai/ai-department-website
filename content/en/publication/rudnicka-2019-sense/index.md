abstract: 'Though the interest in use of wordnets for lexicography is (gradually)
  growing, no research has been conducted so far on equivalence between lexical units
  (or senses) in inter-linked wordnets. In this paper, we present and validate a procedure
  of sense-linking between plWordNet and Princeton WordNet. The proposed procedure
  employs a continuum of three equivalence types: strong, regular and weak, distinguished
  by a custom-designed set of formal, semantic and translational features. To validate
  the procedure, three independent'
