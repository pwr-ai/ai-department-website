abstract: This paper presents a design of a web-based application for textual scholars.
  The goal of this project is to create a complex and stable research environment
  allowing scholars to upload the texts they analyse and either explore them with
  a suite of dedicated tools or transform them into a different format (eg text, table,
  list, spreadsheet). The latter functionality is especially important for research
  focusing on Polish texts (due to the rich morphology and weakly constrained word
  order of Polish) because it allows for their further processing with
