abstract: In this paper, hybrid ant colony optimization (HAntCO) approach in solving
  multi-skill resource-constrained project scheduling problem (MS-RCPSP) has been
  presented. We have proposed hybrid approach that links classical heuristic priority
  rules for project scheduling with ant colony optimization (ACO). Furthermore, a
  novel approach for updating pheromone value has been proposed based on both the
  best and worst solutions stored by ants. The objective of this paper is to research
  the usability and robustness of ACO and its
