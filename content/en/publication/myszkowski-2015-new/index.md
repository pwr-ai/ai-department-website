abstract: In this paper novel project scheduling difficulty estimations are proposed
  for Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP). The
  main goal of introducing the complexity estimations is an attempt of estimation
  the project complexity before launching the optimization process. What is more,
  the dataset instance generator is also presented as a tool to create new instances
  for extending the research area. Furthermore, the dataset proposed in previous works
  is extended by new instances
