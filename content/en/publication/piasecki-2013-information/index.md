abstract: The paper presents a wordnet expansion algorithm, which is based on lexicosemantic
  relations extracted from large text corpora. We do not assume that the extracted
  relation instances (ie word pairs) are described by probabilities. Thus, results
  produced by any method, including pattern-based and Distributional Semantics approaches
  can be used. The algorithm is based on a general spreading activation model. Support
  for word-to-word semantic associations is first mapped on the existing wordnet structure.
  Next, the support is
