 abstract = {The paper presents a wordnet expansion algorithm, which is based on lexicosemantic relations extracted from large text corpora. We do not assume that the extracted relation instances (ie word pairs) are described by probabilities. Thus, results produced by any method, including pattern-based and Distributional Semantics approaches can be used. The algorithm is based on a general spreading activation model. Support for word-to-word semantic associations is first mapped on the existing wordnet structure. Next, the support is},
