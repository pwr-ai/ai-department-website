abstract: Multi-label classification aims to classify instances with discrete non-exclusive
  labels. Most approaches on multi-label classification focus on effective adaptation
  or transformation of existing binary and multi-class learning approaches but fail
  in modelling the joint probability of labels or do not preserve generalization abilities
  for unseen label combinations. To address these issues we propose a new multi-label
  classification scheme, LNEMLC-Label Network Embedding for Multi-Label Classification,
  that embeds the label network and uses it
