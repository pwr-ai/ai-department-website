abstract: 'Network structures, especially social networks, grow rapidly and provide
  huge datasets intractable to analyse. In this paper, two parallel approaches to
  process large graph structures within the Hadoop environment were compared: Bulk
  Synchronous Parallel (BSP) and MapReduce (MR). The experimental studies were carried
  out for two different graph problems: collective classification by means of Relational
  Influence Propagation (RIP) and Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) calculation.
  The appropriate BSP and MapReduce'
