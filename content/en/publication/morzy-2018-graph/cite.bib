 abstract = {Graph energy is the energy of the matrix representation of the graph, where the energy of a matrix is the sum of singular values of the matrix. Depending on the definition of a matrix, one can contemplate graph energy, Randić energy, Laplacian energy, distance energy, and many others. Although theoretical properties of various graph energies have been investigated in the past in the areas of mathematics, chemistry, physics, or graph theory, these explorations have been limited to relatively small graphs representing chemical},
