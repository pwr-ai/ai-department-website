abstract: The scikit-multilearn is a Python library for performing multi-label classification.
  It is compatible with the scikit-learn and scipy ecosystems and uses sparse matrices
  for all internal operations; provides native Python implementations of popular multi-label
  classification methods alongside a novel framework for label space partitioning
  and division and includes modern algorithm adaptation methods, network-based label
  space division approaches, which extracts label dependency information and multi-label
  embedding
