 abstract = {The scikit-multilearn is a Python library for performing multi-label classification. It is compatible with the scikit-learn and scipy ecosystems and uses sparse matrices for all internal operations; provides native Python implementations of popular multi-label classification methods alongside a novel framework for label space partitioning and division and includes modern algorithm adaptation methods, network-based label space division approaches, which extracts label dependency information and multi-label embedding},
