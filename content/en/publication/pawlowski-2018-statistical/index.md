abstract: In the present paper statistical distributions of vocabulary in a big corpus
  of Polish and in its sub-corpora are estimated and compared. A hypothesis is tested
  which states that statistical distributions in the entire corpus and in its sub-corpora
  are different with regard to type and/or parameter values (in case of similar models).
  The research was carried out on the material of a balanced corpus of Polish using
  NLP programming tools prepared in the framework of the CLARIN-PL consortium. The
  results prove that only some parts of speech
