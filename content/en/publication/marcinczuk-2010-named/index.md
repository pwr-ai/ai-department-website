abstract: The paper investigates the accuracy of a Named Entity Recognition (NER)
  algorithm based on the Hidden Markov Model in the domain of Polish stock exchange
  reports. The task of NER was limited to the recognition and classification of Named
  Entities representing persons and companies. The algorithm was tested on a small
  Polish domain corpus of stock exchange reports. A comparison with the baselines
  of the algorithms based on the case of the first letters and a gazetteer is presented.
  The algorithm outperformed both baselines; it
