abstract: Wordnets are built of synsets, not of words. A synset consists of words.
  Synonymy is a relation between words. Words go into a synset because they are synonyms.
  Later, a wordnet treats words as synonymous because they belong in the same synset
  ... Such circularity, a well-known problem, poses a practical difficulty in wordnet
  construction, notably when it comes to maintaining consistency. We propose to make
  a wordnet a net of words or, to be more precise, lexical units. We discuss our assumptions
  and present their
