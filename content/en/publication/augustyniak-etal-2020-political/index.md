abstract:
  Political campaigns are full of political ads posted by candidates on social
  media. Political advertisements constitute a basic form of campaigning, subjected
  to various social requirements. We present the first publicly open dataset for detecting
  specific text chunks and categories of political advertising in the Polish language.
  It contains 1,705 human-annotated tweets tagged with nine categories, which constitute
  campaigning under Polish electoral law. We achieved a 0.65 inter-annotator agreement
  (Cohen′s kappa score). An additional annotator resolved the mismatches between the
  first two annotators improving the consistency and complexity of the annotation
  process. We used the newly created dataset to train a well established neural tagger
  (achieving a 70% percent points F1 score). We also present a possible direction
  of use cases for such datasets and models with an initial analysis of the Polish
  2020 Presidential Elections on Twitter.
