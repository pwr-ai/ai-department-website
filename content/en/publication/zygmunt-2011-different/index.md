abstract: 'Two approaches for identifying key persons in the blogosphere-based social
  network are analysed in the paper: discovery of the most important individuals either
  in persistent or in global social communities existing on web blogs. A new method
  for the separation of stable groups fulfilling given conditions is presented. Additionally,
  a new concept for extraction of user roles and key persons in such groups is proposed.
  It has been compared to the general clustering method and structural node position
  measure applied to rank users in the time'
