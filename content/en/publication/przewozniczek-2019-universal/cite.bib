 abstract = {Multi-population approach, also known as Island Model (IM), is a well-known technique improving diversity preservation. It is employed by evolutionary and Swarm Intelligence methods. The diversity increased through the maintenance of many subpopulations, leads to finding higher quality solutions. Since IM is computationally expensive, it is important to keep the balance between the diversity maintenance and the convergence. Therefore, this paper concentrates on proposing the new strategy of Dynamic Subpopulation Number Control},
