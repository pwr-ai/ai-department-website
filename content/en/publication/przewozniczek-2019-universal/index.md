abstract: Multi-population approach, also known as Island Model (IM), is a well-known
  technique improving diversity preservation. It is employed by evolutionary and Swarm
  Intelligence methods. The diversity increased through the maintenance of many subpopulations,
  leads to finding higher quality solutions. Since IM is computationally expensive,
  it is important to keep the balance between the diversity maintenance and the convergence.
  Therefore, this paper concentrates on proposing the new strategy of Dynamic Subpopulation
  Number Control
