abstract: Since the amount of information is rapidly growing, there is an overwhelming
  interest in efficient network computing. In this article, we take a detailed look
  at the problem of modelling and optimization of aforementioned systems for k-nearest
  neighbour classifier. First, we present a comprehensive discussion on considered
  classification methods with a special focus on improving classification accuracy
  or response time through the use of partitions of original data set for the nearest
  neighbour rule. Next, we propose a generic
