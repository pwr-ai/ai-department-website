abstract: The paper presents the supermatrix system, which was designed as a general
  tool supporting automatic acquisition of lexical semantic relations from corpora.
  The construction of the system is discussed, but also examples of different applications
  showing the potential of supermatrix are given. The core of the system is construction
  of co-incidence matrices from corpora written in any natural language as the system
  works on UTF-8 encoding and possesses modular construction. Supermatrix follows
  the general scheme of distributional
