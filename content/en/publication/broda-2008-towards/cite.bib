 abstract = {Morphological processing of Polish is seriously hampered by the poor availability of general-purpose tools. This article presents an attempt to create such a set of tools following the de facto standard of the IPIC corpus. Currently, the package contains pieces of software able to perform the following tasks: text tokenisation, morphological analysis with heuristics for unknown words, division into sentences and morphosyntactic disambiguation. The described tools will be made available under the GNU general public licence.},
