abstract: 'Morphological processing of Polish is seriously hampered by the poor availability
  of general-purpose tools. This article presents an attempt to create such a set
  of tools following the de facto standard of the IPIC corpus. Currently, the package
  contains pieces of software able to perform the following tasks: text tokenisation,
  morphological analysis with heuristics for unknown words, division into sentences
  and morphosyntactic disambiguation. The described tools will be made available under
  the GNU general public licence.'
