abstract: This paper presents a supervised approach to the recognition of Crossdocument
  Structure Theory (CST) relations in Polish texts. Its core is a graphbased representation
  constructed for sentences. Graphs are built on the basis of lexicalised syntactic-semantic
  relations extracted from text. Similarity between sentences is calculated as similarity
  between their graphs, and the values are used as features to train the classifiers.
  Several different configurations of graphs, as well as graph similarity methods
  were analysed for this task
