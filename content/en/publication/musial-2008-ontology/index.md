abstract: In this paper, a new framework for recommendation of multimedia objects
  in the environment of the multimedia sharing system was proposed. It uses two kinds
  of individual ontologies one is created for multimedia objects and the second one
  for system users. The final recommendation process takes into account similarities
  calculated both between objects' and users' ontologies. These individual ontologies
  respect all the social and semantic features existing in the system. The entire
  recommender framework was developed for the
publication: '*System Science*'
