abstract: Wordnets can be translated from another language or can be built from corpus
  evidence. The transfer approach is easier and quicker, which is why it has been
  most widely used. However, it has a big disadvantage that the created resource does
  not necessarily reflect the language in question. This is why in this paper we test
  a language-motivated approach that uses linguistically annotated corpus data and
  basic statistical methods to extract lists of semantically similar words that are
  then incorporated into the wordnet for Slovene. The
publication: '*Slovenščina 2.0: empirical, applied and interdisciplinary research*'
