abstract: Social networks have been one of the important issues in various domains,
  eg, e-business [Jung 2012], and e-learning [Gan and Zhu 2007, Jung 2010]. In our
  computer systems, we have possibility to process data about interactions and activities
  of millions of individuals. Communication and multiple user technologies allow us
  to form large networks which in turn shape and catalyst our activities. Due to scale,
  complexity and dynamics, these networks are extremely difficult to analyze in terms
  of traditional social network analysis methods [Jung
