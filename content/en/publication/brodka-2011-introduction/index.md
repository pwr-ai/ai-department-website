abstract: Social communities extraction and their dynamics are one of the most important
  problems in today's social network analysis. During last few years, many researchers
  have proposed their own methods for group discovery in social networks. However,
  almost none of them have noticed that modern social networks are much more complex
  than few years ago. Due to vast amount of different data about various user activities
  available in IT systems, it is possible to distinguish the new class of social networks
  called multi-layered social network
