abstract: The large tagset, the limited size of corpora and the free word order are
  the main causes for achieving low accuracy of tagging Polish by applying the commonly
  used techniques based on stochastic modelling. The proposed architecture of the
  Polish tagger called TaKIPI created the possibility for using different types of
  classifiers in tagging, but only C4. 5 Decision Trees were applied initially. The
  goal of this paper is to explore the range of promising rule based classifiers and
  to investigate their impact on the accuracy of tagging
