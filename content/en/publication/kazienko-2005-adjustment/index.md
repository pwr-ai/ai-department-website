abstract: 'Indirect association rules are the extension of classic association rules
  that enables to discover indirect relationships existing between objects. To estimate
  the importance of individual parameters of the indirect association rules mining,
  experiments were carried out on historical web user sessions coming from an e-commerce
  portal. The influence of parameters of standard direct rules: direct support and
  direct confidence thresholds, was studied and it was proved that greater values
  of these two thresholds could significantly'
