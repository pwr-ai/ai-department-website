abstract: Usually, the launch of the diffusion process is triggered by a few early
  adopters–ie, seeds of diffusion. Many studies have assumed that all seeds are activated
  once to initiate the diffusion process in social networks and therefore are focused
  on finding optimal ways of choosing these nodes according to a limited budget. Despite
  the advances in identifying influencing spreaders, the strategy of activating all
  seeds at the beginning might not be sufficient in accelerating and maximising the
  coverage of diffusion. Also, it does not capture
