abstract: In the world, in which acceptance and the identification with social communities
  are highly desired, the ability to predict the evolution of groups over time appears
  to be a vital but very complex research problem. Therefore, we propose a new, adaptable,
  generic, and multistage method for Group Evolution Prediction (GEP) in complex networks,
  that facilitates reasoning about the future states of the recently discovered groups.
  The precise GEP modularity enabled us to carry out extensive and versatile empirical
  studies on many real
