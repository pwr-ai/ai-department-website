abstract: In this paper we present a new individual measure for the task of evocation
  strength prediction. The proposed solution is based on Dijkstra's distances calculated
  on the WordNet graph expanded with polysemy relations. The polysemy network was
  constructed using chaining procedure executed on individual word senses of polysemous
  lemmas. We show that the shape of polysemy associations between WordNet senses has
  a positive impact on evocation strength prediction and the measure itself could
  be successfully reused
