abstract: The probability that we get help is greater if we ask a friend, rather than
  a stranger. On the basis of this sociological phenomenon, the innovative SocLaKE
  recommender system for query propagation in the social network was invented. In
  this paper, a general concept of the system as well as a discussion on various issues
  and challenges related to its application are presented.
