 abstract = {The probability that we get help is greater if we ask a friend, rather than a stranger. On the basis of this sociological phenomenon, the innovative SocLaKE recommender system for query propagation in the social network was invented. In this paper, a general concept of the system as well as a discussion on various issues and challenges related to its application are presented.},
