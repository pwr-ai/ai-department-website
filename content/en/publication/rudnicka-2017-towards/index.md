abstract: 'The paper focuses on the issue of creating equivalence links in the domain
  of bilingual computational lexicography. The existing interlingual links between
  plWordNet and Princeton WordNet synsets (sets of synonymous lexical units–lemma
  and sense pairs) are re-analysed from the perspective of equivalence types as defined
  in traditional lexicography and translation. Special attention is paid to cognitive
  and translational equivalents. A proposal of mapping lexical units is presented.
  Three types of links are defined: super-strong'
