abstract: In this paper, we propose an optimization system based on an evolutionary
  algorithm developed to solve a real-life optimization problem related to the optimization
  of the computer networks. In particular, we focus on an NP-hard flow allocation
  problem in computer networks related to network survivability and addressing various
  constraints specific to computer networks. The constrained problems are usually
  handled by evolutionary methods by the introduction of the so-called penalty factor.
