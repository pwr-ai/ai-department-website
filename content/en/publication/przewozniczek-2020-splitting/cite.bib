 abstract = {In this paper, we propose an optimization system based on an evolutionary algorithm developed to solve a real-life optimization problem related to the optimization of the computer networks. In particular, we focus on an NP-hard flow allocation problem in computer networks related to network survivability and addressing various constraints specific to computer networks. The constrained problems are usually handled by evolutionary methods by the introduction of the so-called penalty factor. However, such},
