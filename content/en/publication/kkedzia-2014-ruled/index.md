abstract: 'In this paper we study a rule-based approach to mapping plWordNet onto
  SUMO Upper Ontology on the basis of the already existing mappings: plWordNet--the
  Princeton WordNet--SUMO. Information acquired from the inter-lingual relations between
  plWordNet and Princeton WordNet and the relations between Princeton WordNet and
  SUMO ontology are used in the proposed rules. Several mapping rules together with

  in two steps,(i) we automatically'
