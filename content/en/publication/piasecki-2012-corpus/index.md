abstract: Derivational relations are an important part of the lexical semantics system
  in many languages, especially those of rich inflection. They represent wide variety
  of semantic oppositions. Analysis of morphological word forms in terms of prefixes
  and suffixes provides limited information about their semantics. We propose a method
  of semantic classification of the potential derivational pairs. The method is based
  on supervised learning, but requires only a list of word pairs assigned to the derivational
  relations. The classification was based
