abstract: Current research in Evolutionary Computation concentrates on proposing more
  and more sophisticated methods that are supposed to be more effective than their
  predecessors. New mechanisms, like linkage learning (LL) that improve the overall
  method effectiveness, are also proposed. These research directions are promising
  and lead to effectiveness increase that cannot be questioned. Nevertheless, in this
  paper, we concentrate on a situation in which the simplification of the method leads
  to the improvement of its
