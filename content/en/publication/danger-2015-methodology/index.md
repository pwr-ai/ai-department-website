abstract: Data mining of electronic health records (eHRs) allows us to identify patterns
  of patient data that characterize diseases and their progress and learn best practices
  for treatment and diagnosis. Clinical Prediction Rules (CPRs) are a form of clinical
  evidence that quantifies the contribution of different clinical data to a particular
  clinical outcome and help clinicians to decide the diagnosis, prognosis or therapeutic
  conduct for any given patient. The TRANSFoRm diagnostic support system (DSS) is
  based on the construction of an
