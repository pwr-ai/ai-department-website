abstract: A new framework for recommendation of multimedia objects based on individual
  ontologies is presented in the paper. The recommendation process takes into account
  similarities calculated both between objects' and users' ontologies that respect
  the social and semantic features existing in the system. The system was developed
  for the use inthe Flickr multimedia sharing system.
