abstract: Choosing model parameters is an important issue for solving real word problems.
  Wrong parameter values result in low performance of employed model. Usually, parameters
  are chosen manual, but one can employ metaheuristics for searching the parameter
  space in more systematic and automated way. In this paper we test a few optimisation
  methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms, Tabu Search, Hill Climbing and Simulated
  Annealing for setting parameters of models in two problems in the domain of Natural
  Language Processing
