 abstract = {Choosing model parameters is an important issue for solving real word problems. Wrong parameter values result in low performance of employed model. Usually, parameters are chosen manual, but one can employ metaheuristics for searching the parameter space in more systematic and automated way. In this paper we test a few optimisation methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms, Tabu Search, Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing for setting parameters of models in two problems in the domain of Natural Language Processing},
