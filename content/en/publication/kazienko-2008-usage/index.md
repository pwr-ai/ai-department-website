abstract: 'The new approach to structure verification of the Web hyperlinks is presented
  in the paper. It utilizes several types of patterns extracted from the Web usage
  data: positive and negative association rules, positive sequential patterns as well
  as the new kind of patterns-sequential patterns with negative conclusions. All they
  enable to appraise the usefulness of hyperlinks in both the positive and negative
  way. Based on this knowledge, the content managers can adequately promote the trustworthy
  hyperlinks and remove the negatively verified ones.'
