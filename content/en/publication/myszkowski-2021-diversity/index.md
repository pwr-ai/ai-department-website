abstract: The paper introduces a novel many-objective evolutionary method, with a
  diversity-based selection operator and aims to fill the “gaps” in the Pareto Front
  approximation and to increase its spread. It shows, that guiding the evolution process
  towards the least explored parts of a space increases overall diversity, but can
  also lead to increased convergence. A set of experiments is carried out on a many-objective
  Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem and a bi-objective Travelling
  Thief Problem. Both of those
