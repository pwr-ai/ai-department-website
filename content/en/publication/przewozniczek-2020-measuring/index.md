abstract: Linkage learning is frequently employed in modern evolutionary algorithms.
  High linkage quality may be the key to an evolutionary method's effectiveness. Similarly,
  the faulty linkage may be the reason for its poor performance. Many state-of-the-art
  evolutionary methods use a Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) to obtain linkage.
  In this paper, we propose a quality measure for DSM. Based on this measure, we analyze
  the behavior of modern evolutionary methods. We show the dependency between the
  linkage and the effectiveness of the
