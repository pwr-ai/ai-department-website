abstract: Self-organising Logic of Structures (SLS), a semantic representation language
  of high expressive power, seems attractive from a theoretical point of view. To
  check its usefulness for natural language understanding systems, an implementation
  is required. This article presents our efforts aimed at computational verification
  of SLS. We discuss some computational problems and propose a solution based on Constraint
  Logic Programming. An experimental implementation of a modelchecker for dynamic
  formulae is presented. It
