abstract: Emotion and affect recognition in the uncontrolled everyday-life environment
  remains challenging. One of its vital problems is collecting numerous annotated
  emotional samples indispensable for learning the reasoning model. We propose a novel
  method supporting rich emotional data collection-a pre-trained binary model recognizing
  physiologically arousing events in real-time and triggering self-assessments at
  a convenient point in time. An experimental study on 6.000 hours of recorded physiological
  signals has been performed
