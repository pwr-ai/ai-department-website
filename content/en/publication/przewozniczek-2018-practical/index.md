abstract: The usual assumption in the Evolutionary Computation field is that a cost
  of computing single fitness function evaluation is at last similar for all cases.
  Such assumption does not have to be true. In this paper we consider the recently
  proposed Problem Encoding Allowing Cheap Fitness Computation of Mutated Individuals
  (PEACh) effect that allows to significantly reduce the computation load of some
  of the fitness computations that occur during the evolutionary method run. To the
  best of our knowledge, it is the first experimental analysis
