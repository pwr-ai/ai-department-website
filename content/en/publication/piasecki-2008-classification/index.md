abstract: Manual construction of a wordnet can be facilitated by a system that suggests
  semantic relations acquired from corpora. Such systems tend to produce many wrong
  suggestions. We propose a method of filtering a raw list of noun pairs potentially
  linked by hypernymy, and test it on Polish. The method aims for good recall and
  sufficient precision. The classifiers work with complex features that give clues
  on the relation between the nouns. We apply a corpus-based measure of semantic relatedness
  enhanced with a Rank Weight Function
