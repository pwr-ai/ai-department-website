abstract: Weblog, often called an “electronic journal”, is a simple website containing
  posts displayed in the reversed chronological order, which can usually be commented
  by other users (cf. McNeil 2003). It is not a simple recreation of a journal in
  the digital environment but rather a complex remediation of traditional genres (eg
  journal, diary, letter) under the influence of electronic discourse, which entails
  such phenomena as secondary orality and interaction with the user (cf. Davis and
  Brewer 1997). Although blogging is a relatively new
publication: '*Practical Applications of Linguistic Corpora Conference*'
