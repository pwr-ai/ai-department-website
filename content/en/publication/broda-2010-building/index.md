abstract: A limited prototype of the CLARIN Language Technology Infrastructure (LTI)
  node is presented. The node prototype provides several types of web services for
  Polish. The functionality encompasses morpho-syntactic processing, shallow semantic
  processing of corpus on the basis of the SuperMatrix system and plWordNet browsing.
  We take the prototype as the starting point for the discussion on requirements that
  must be fulfilled by the LTI. Some possible solutions are proposed for less frequently
  discussed problems, eg

  \ and Evaluation (LREC'10)*"
