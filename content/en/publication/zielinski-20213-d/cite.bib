 abstract = {In this paper, we address a problem of vision-based 3D robotic navigation using deep reinforcement learning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub 2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot's steering settings using the data acquired from the robot's sensors},
