abstract: In this paper, we address a problem of vision-based 3D robotic navigation
  using deep reinforcement learning for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). Our
  research offers conclusions from the experimental study based on one of the RoboSub
  2018 competition tasks. However, it can be generalized to any navigation task consisting
  of movement from a starting point to the front of the next station. The presented
  reinforcement learning-based model predicts the robot's steering settings using
  the data acquired from the robot's sensors
