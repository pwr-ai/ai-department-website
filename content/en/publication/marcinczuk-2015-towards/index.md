abstract: The paper presents a typology of events built on the basis of TimeML specification
  adapted to Polish language. Some changes were introduced to the definition of the
  event categories and a motivation for event categorization was formulated. The event
  annotation task is presented on two levels–ontology level (language independent)
  and text mentions (language dependant). The various types of event mentions in Polish
  text are discussed. A procedure for annotation of event mentions in Polish texts
  is presented and evaluated. In the
