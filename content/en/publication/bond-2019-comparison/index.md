abstract: In this paper, we compare a variety of sense-tagged sentiment resources,
  including SentiWordNet, ML-Senticon, plWordNet emo and the NTU Multilingual Corpus.
  The goal is to investigate the quality of the resources and see how well the sentiment
  polarity annotation maps across languages.
