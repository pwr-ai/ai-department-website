abstract: Problem decomposition is an important part of many state-of-the-art Evolutionary
  Algorithms (EAs). The quality of the decomposition may be decisive for the EA effectiveness
  and efficiency. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the recent proposition of
  Linkage Learning based on Local Optimization (3LO). 3LO is an empirical linkage
  learning (ELL) technique and is proven never to report the false linkage. False
  linkage is one of the possible linkage defects and occurs when linkage marks two
  independent genes as a dependent. Although
