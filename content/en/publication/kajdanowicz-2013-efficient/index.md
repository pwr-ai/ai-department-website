abstract: Collective classification algorithms with underlying network structure of
  related entities are a powerful modelling tool that can address collaborative decision
  making problems. The paper presents the usage of collective classification algorithms
  for classification problem in which unknown nodes are assigned with classes based
  on the classes of known nodes. In such problem the classification decision for particular
  node is inferred from collaborative knowledge of nodes with known classes and underlying
  network connections. The paper
