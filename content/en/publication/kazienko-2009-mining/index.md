abstract: 'Classical association rules, here called\" direct\", reflect relationships
  existing between items that relatively often co-occur in common transactions. In
  the web domain, items correspond to pages and transactions to user sessions. The
  main idea of the new approach presented is to discover indirect associations existing
  between pages that rarely occur together but there are other,\" third\" pages, called
  transitive, with which they appear relatively frequently. Two types of indirect
  associations rules are described in the paper: partial indirect associations'
