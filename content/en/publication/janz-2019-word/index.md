abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation remains a challenging NLP task. Due to the lack
  of annotated training data, especially for rare senses, the supervised approaches
  are usually designed for specific subdomains limited to a narrow subset of identified
  senses. Recent advances in this area have shown that knowledge-based approaches
  are more scalable and obtain more promising results in all-words WSD scenarios.
  In this work we present a faster WSD algorithm based on the Monte Carlo approximation
  of sense probabilities given
