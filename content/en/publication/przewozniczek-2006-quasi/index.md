abstract: The main objective of this paper is to develop an effective evolutionary
  algorithm (EA) for the path-assignment problem in survivable connection-oriented
  networks. We assume a single-link failure scenario, which is the most common and
  frequently reported failure event. Since the network flow is modeled as a non-bifurcated
  multicommodity flow, the discussed optimization problem is NP-complete. Thus, we
  develop an effective heuristic algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm. The
  main novelty of this work is that the proposed
