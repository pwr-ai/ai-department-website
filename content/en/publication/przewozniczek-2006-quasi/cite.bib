 abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to develop an effective evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the path-assignment problem in survivable connection-oriented networks. We assume a single-link failure scenario, which is the most common and frequently reported failure event. Since the network flow is modeled as a non-bifurcated multicommodity flow, the discussed optimization problem is NP-complete. Thus, we develop an effective heuristic algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm. The main novelty of this work is that the proposed},
