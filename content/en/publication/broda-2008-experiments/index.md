abstract: The aim of this work is to explore document clustering techniques for the
  needs of semi automatic construction of a lexical semantic network for Polish. Although
  the majority of research in this area is based on measures of distributional similarity
  calculated from co-occurrences of words in large collections of documents, we wanted
  to approach a difficult problem of meaning ambiguity resolution from a different
  direction. During the research we have faced and addressed several problems of keyword
  extraction from document groups
