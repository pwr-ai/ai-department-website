 abstract = {The aim of this work is to explore document clustering techniques for the needs of semi automatic construction of a lexical semantic network for Polish. Although the majority of research in this area is based on measures of distributional similarity calculated from co-occurrences of words in large collections of documents, we wanted to approach a difficult problem of meaning ambiguity resolution from a different direction. During the research we have faced and addressed several problems of keyword extraction from document groups},
