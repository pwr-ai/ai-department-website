abstract: In the paper, a novel concept of two-level handwritten word recognizer is
  presented, which uses language models on word and character levels. Word level unigram
  language model (called here probabilistic lexicon) contains words most frequently
  appearing in the domain of texts being recognized with their prior probabilities.
  The probabilistic lexicon does not have to be complete but the recognizer is expected
  to recognize also words that do not belong to the lexicon. The proposed recognizer
  is a combination of two simpler word soft classifiers
