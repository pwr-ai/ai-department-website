abstract: We proposed a new accurate aspect extraction method that makes use of both
  word and character-based embeddings. We have conducted experiments of various models
  of aspect extraction using LSTM and BiLSTM including CRF enhancement on five different
  pre-trained word embeddings extended with character embeddings. The results revealed
  that BiLSTM outperforms regular LSTM, but also word embedding coverage in train
  and test sets profoundly impacted aspect detection performance. Moreover, the additional
  CRF layer
