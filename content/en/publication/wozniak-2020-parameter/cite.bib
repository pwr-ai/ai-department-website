 abstract = {Linkage learning is frequently employed in state-of-the-art methods dedicated to discrete optimization domains. Information about linkage identifies a subgroup of genes that are found dependent on each other. If such information is precise and properly used, it may significantly improve a method's effectiveness. The recent research shows that to solve problems with so-called overlapping blocks, it is not enough to use linkage of high quality–it is also necessary to use many different linkages that are diverse. Taking into account that},
