abstract: E-Learning environments nowadays should adapt to their users and computer
  platforms they are using. In this paper the learning scenario collaborative recommendation
  based on consensus method using XML is presented. We present the XML description
  of the learning scenario and its components as well as the link database and XSL
  transformations for presenting them on given platforms in the way suitable for particular
  students.
