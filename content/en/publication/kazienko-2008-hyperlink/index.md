abstract: The new HRS method for hyperlink recommendation based on positive and confined
  negative association rules is presented in the paper. Discovered with the new PANAMA
  algorithm rules are merged and used in the form of recommendation functions, both
  to assess the existing hyperlinks and to suggest new ones. Positively and negatively
  verified and new hyperlinks are presented to the content manager and can considerably
  facilitate the maintenance of the web site structure and its adjustment to user
  behaviour. The
