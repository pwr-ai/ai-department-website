abstract: 'Coloured network motifs are small subgraphs that enable to discover and
  interpret the patterns of interaction within the complex networks. The analysis
  of three-nodes motifs where the colour of the node reflects its high–white node
  or low–black node centrality in the social network is presented in the paper. The
  importance of the vertices is assessed by utilizing two measures: degree prestige
  and degree centrality. The distribution of motifs in these two cases is compared
  to mine the interconnection patterns between nodes. The'
