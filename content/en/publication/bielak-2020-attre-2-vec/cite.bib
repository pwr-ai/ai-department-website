 abstract = {Representation learning has overcome the often arduous and manual featurization of networks through (unsupervised) feature learning as it results in embeddings that can apply to a variety of downstream learning tasks. The focus of representation learning on graphs has focused mainly on shallow (node-centric) or deep (graph-based) learning approaches. While there have been approaches that work on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks with multi-typed nodes and edges, there is a gap in learning edge representations},
