abstract: Representation learning has overcome the often arduous and manual featurization
  of networks through (unsupervised) feature learning as it results in embeddings
  that can apply to a variety of downstream learning tasks. The focus of representation
  learning on graphs has focused mainly on shallow (node-centric) or deep (graph-based)
  learning approaches. While there have been approaches that work on homogeneous and
  heterogeneous networks with multi-typed nodes and edges, there is a gap in learning
  edge representations
