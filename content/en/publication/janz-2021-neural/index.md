abstract: Neural language models, including transformer-based models, that are pre-trained
  on very large corpora became a common way to represent text in various tasks, including
  recognition of textual semantic relations, eg Cross-document Structure Theory. Pre-trained
  models are usually fine tuned to downstream tasks and the obtained vectors are used
  as an input for deep neural classifiers. No linguistic knowledge obtained from resources
  and tools is utilised. In this paper we compare such universal approaches with a
  combination of rich
