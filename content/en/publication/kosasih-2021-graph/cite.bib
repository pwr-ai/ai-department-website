 abstract = {In order to advance large-scale graph machine learning, the Open Graph Benchmark Large Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) was proposed at the KDD Cup 2021. The PCQM4M-LSC dataset defines a molecular HOMO-LUMO property prediction task on about 3.8 M graphs. In this short paper, we show our current work-in-progress solution which builds an ensemble of three graph neural networks models based on GIN, Bayesian Neural Networks and DiffPool. Our approach outperforms the provided baseline by 7.6%. Moreover, using uncertainty in},
