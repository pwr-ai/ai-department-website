abstract: In order to advance large-scale graph machine learning, the Open Graph Benchmark
  Large Scale Challenge (OGB-LSC) was proposed at the KDD Cup 2021. The PCQM4M-LSC
  dataset defines a molecular HOMO-LUMO property prediction task on about 3.8 M graphs.
  In this short paper, we show our current work-in-progress solution which builds
  an ensemble of three graph neural networks models based on GIN, Bayesian Neural
  Networks and DiffPool. Our approach outperforms the provided baseline by 7.6%. Moreover,
  using uncertainty in
