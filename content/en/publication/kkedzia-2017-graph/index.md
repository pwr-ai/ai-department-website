abstract: This paper presents an supervised approach to the recognition of Cross-document
  Structure Theory (CST) relations in Polish texts. In the proposed, graph-based representation
  is constructed for sentences. Graphs are built on the basis of lexicalised syntactic-semantic
  relation extracted from text. Similarity between sentences is calculated from graph,
  and the similarity values are input to classifiers trained by Logistic Model Tree.
  Several different configurations of graph, as well as graph similarity methods were
  analysed for this tasks
