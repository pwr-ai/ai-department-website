abstract: Representation learning on graphs has emerged as a powerful mechanism to
  automate feature vector generation for downstream machine learning tasks. The advances
  in representation on graphs have centered on both homogeneous and heterogeneous
  graphs, where the latter presenting the challenges associated with multi-typed nodes
  and/or edges. In this paper, we consider the additional challenge of evolving graphs.
  We ask the question of whether the advances in representation learning for static
  graphs can be
