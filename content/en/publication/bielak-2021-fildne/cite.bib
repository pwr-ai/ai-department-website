 abstract = {Representation learning on graphs has emerged as a powerful mechanism to automate feature vector generation for downstream machine learning tasks. The advances in representation on graphs have centered on both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, where the latter presenting the challenges associated with multi-typed nodes and/or edges. In this paper, we consider the additional challenge of evolving graphs. We ask the question of whether the advances in representation learning for static graphs can be},
