abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation in text is still a difficult problem as the best
  supervised methods require laborious and costly manual preparation of training data.
  On the other hand, the unsupervised methods express significantly lower accuracy
  and produce results that are not satisfying for many application. The goal of this
  work is to develop a model of Word Sense Disambiguation which minimises the amount
  of the required human intervention, but still assigns senses that come from a manually
  created lexical semantics resource, ie, a wordnet
