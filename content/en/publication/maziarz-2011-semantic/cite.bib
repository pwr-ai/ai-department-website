 abstract = {The paper describes a system of lexico-semantic relations proposed for the nominal part of plWordNet 2.0—the largest Polish wordnet. We briefly introduce a wordnet as a large electronic thesaurus. We discuss sixteen nominal relations together with many sub-types proposed for plWordNet 2.0. Each relation is based on linguistic intuition and supported by a set of tests which facilitate its identification. There are two main groups: pure lexico-semantic relations and semanticderivational relations},
