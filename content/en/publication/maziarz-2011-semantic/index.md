abstract: 'The paper describes a system of lexico-semantic relations proposed for
  the nominal part of plWordNet 2.0—the largest Polish wordnet. We briefly introduce
  a wordnet as a large electronic thesaurus. We discuss sixteen nominal relations
  together with many sub-types proposed for plWordNet 2.0. Each relation is based
  on linguistic intuition and supported by a set of tests which facilitate its identification.
  There are two main groups: pure lexico-semantic relations and semanticderivational
  relations'
