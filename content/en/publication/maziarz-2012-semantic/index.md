abstract: 'Adjectives in wordnets are often neglected: there are many fewer of them
  than nouns, and relations among them are sometimes not as varied as those among
  nouns or verbs. Polish WordNet 1.0 was no exception. Version 2.0 aims to correct
  that. We present an overview of a much larger set of lexical-semantic relations
  which connect adjectives to the other parts of the network. Our choice of relations
  has been motivated by linguistic considerations, especially the concerns of the
  Polish lexical semantics, and by pragmatic reasons. The'
