abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully utilized in numerous NLP
  tasks, including sequence labeling. In this work, we utilize three transformer-based
  models (XLM-R, HerBERT, mBERT) to improve recognition quality using MTL for selected
  low-resource language (Polish) and three disjoint sequence labeling tasks with different
  levels of inter-annotator agreement. Our best MTL model outperforms single-task
  models both within the tasks domain and overall performance.
