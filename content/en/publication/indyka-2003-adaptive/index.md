abstract: The paper starts with a short overview on areas of application for user
  profiles. Subsequently a method to represent user profile in the field of document
  retrieval by using query terms and weighted terms of retrieved documents is defined.
  The method is based on evaluating the pertinence of retrieved documents by the user.
  The created subprofiles are used to express the translation between terminology
  used by user and terminology accepted in some field of knowledge. Finally, the preliminary
  experiments are discussed.
