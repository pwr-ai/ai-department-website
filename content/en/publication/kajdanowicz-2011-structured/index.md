abstract: The paper describes the method for structured output classification that
  is able to perform classification task for unknown shape of output structure. In
  previous work authors provided that the classification of the element in the output
  structure can be performed using standard input of the instance (its profile) as
  well as all other preceding output elements (already classified) as learning attributes.
  Now they present how the order of the score function application to each element
  of output space is important and may determine the overall
