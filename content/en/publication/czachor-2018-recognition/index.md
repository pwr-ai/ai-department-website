abstract: Word embeddings were used for the extraction of hyponymy relation in several
  approaches, but also it was recently shown that they should not work, in fact. In
  our work we verified both claims using a very large wordnet of Polish as a gold
  standard for lexico-semantic relations and word embeddings extracted from a very
  large corpus of Polish. We showed that a hyponymy extraction method based on linear
  regression classifiers trained on clusters of vectors can be successfully applied
  on large scale. We presented also a possible
