abstract: In the paper a method of optimal selection of utterances used as command
  entry-words for voice controlled application is presented. Voice controlled programs
  seem to be particularly useful in the area of medical informatics, where a physician
  interacts with a program by voice while operating the medical device or being involved
  in examinations requiring manual activities. The proposed method selects command
  words from sets of proposals defined for each command so as to minimize the overall
  probability of incorrect command
