abstract: 'In the paper we discuss the problem of low recall for the named entity
  (NE) recognition task for Polish. We discuss to what extent the recall of NE recognition
  can be improved by reducing the space of NE categories. We also present several
  extensions to the binary model which give an improvement of the recall. The extensions
  include: new features, application of external knowledge and post-processing. For
  the partial evaluation the final model obtained 90.02% recall with 91.30% precision
  on the corpus of economic news.'
