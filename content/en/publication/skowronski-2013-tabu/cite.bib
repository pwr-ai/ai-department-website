 abstract = {In this article two approaches of Tabu Search in Multi-Skill Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (MS-RCPSP) have been proposed, based on different neighbourhood generation methods. The first approach assumes swapping resources assigned to pair of tasks, while the second one proposes assigning any resource that could perform given task. Both approaches need to respect the skill constraints. The objective of this paper is to research the usability and robustness of proposed approaches in solving MS-RCPSP},
