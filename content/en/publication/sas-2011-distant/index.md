abstract: In the paper the problem of language modeling for automatic speech recognition
  in loose word order languages is considered. In loose word order languages classical
  n-gram language models are less effective, because the ordered word sequences encountered
  in the language corpus used to build the language models are less specific than
  in the case of strict word order languages. Because a word set appearing in the
  phrase is likely to appear in other permutation, all permutations of word sequences
  encountered in the corpus should
