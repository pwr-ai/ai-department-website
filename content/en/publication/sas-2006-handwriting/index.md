abstract: In this paper, two level handwriting recognition concept is presented, where
  writer identification is used in order to increase handwriting recognition accuracy.
  On the upper level, author identification is performed. Lower level consists of
  a classifiers set trained on samples coming from individual writers. Recognition
  from upper level is used on the lower level for selecting or combining classifiers
  trained for identified writers. The feature set used on the upper level contains
  directional features as well as the features characteristic for
