abstract: Computing layer similarities is an important way of characterizing multiplex
  networks because various static properties and dynamic processes depend on the relationships
  between layers. We provide a taxonomy and experimental evaluation of approaches
  to compare layers in multiplex networks. Our taxonomy includes, systematizes and
  extends existing approaches, and is complemented by a set of practical guidelines
  on how to apply them.
