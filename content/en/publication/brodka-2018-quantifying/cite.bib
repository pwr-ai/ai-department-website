 abstract = {Computing layer similarities is an important way of characterizing multiplex networks because various static properties and dynamic processes depend on the relationships between layers. We provide a taxonomy and experimental evaluation of approaches to compare layers in multiplex networks. Our taxonomy includes, systematizes and extends existing approaches, and is complemented by a set of practical guidelines on how to apply them.},
