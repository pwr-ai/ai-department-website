 abstract = {Smartphones have become an integral part of our lives. One of their crucial functionalities is sharing data. We analyze the communication modules in Android devices (WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC) in terms of parallel data streaming capabilities. We find that increasing the number of concurrent threads reduces the broadcast time, but also consumes a lot of other resources, eg RAM. Furthermore, the linear increase in the number of threads created does not guarantee the linear decrease in transfer time. We also find that the Bluetooth 5.0 has, in},
