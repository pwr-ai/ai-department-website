abstract: Espresso is a pattern-based algorithm of extracting lexical-semantic relations,
  defined for English. We present its adaptation to Polish. We consider not only the
  technicalities such as the availability of language-processing tools for Polish,
  but also pattern structures which leverage the specificity of a strongly inflected
  language. We propose a new method of computing the reliability measure of extraction;
  this leads to a modified algorithm which we have named Estratto. In this paper we
  investigate the influence of additional lexico-semantic
