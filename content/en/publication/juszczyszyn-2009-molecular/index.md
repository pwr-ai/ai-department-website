abstract: The dynamic of complex social networks is nowadays one of the research areas
  of growing importance. The knowledge about the temporal changes of the network topology
  and characteristics is crucial in networked communication systems in which accurate
  predictions are important. In this paper a physics-inspired method to track the
  changes within complex social network is proposed. This method is based on the dynamic
  molecular modelling technique used in physics for simulation of large sets of interacting
  particles. The data for the
