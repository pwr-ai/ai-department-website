abstract: A revised model for the description of verbs in plWordNet-a large wordnet
  of Polish is presented in the paper. The model has originated from the previous
  one (the versions 2.0 and 3.0) as a combination of simplifications and expansions.
  The simplifications were motivated by the collected experience of the previous model
  implementation for almost 18 thousand Polish verbs. The proposed expansions are
  meant to improve the description of verbs and support provided by plWordNet for
  various applications.
