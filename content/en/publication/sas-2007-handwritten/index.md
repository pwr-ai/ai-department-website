abstract: In the paper a new method of handwritten word recognition is described.
  In this method different probabilistic character language models (PCLMs) are used
  in order to improve the word recognition accuracy. These models consist of conditional
  probability distributions of characters given that preceding, succeeding or surrounding
  characters are known. The application of character succession and precedence in
  word recognition was explored in many earlier works. The novelty of the method proposed
  here consists in utilizing also the
