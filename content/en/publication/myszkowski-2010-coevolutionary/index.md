abstract: This paper describes our last research results in the field of evolutionary
  algorithms for rule extraction applied to classification (and image annotation).
  We focus on the data mining classification task and we propose evolutionary algorithm
  for rule extraction. Presented approach is based on binary classical genetic algorithm
  with representation ofif-then'rules and we propose two specialized genetic operators.
  We want to show that some search space reduction techniques make possible to get
  solution comparable to others from
