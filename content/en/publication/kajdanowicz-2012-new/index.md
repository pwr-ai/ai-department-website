abstract: Choosing a proper training set for machine learning tasks is of great importance
  in complex domain problems. In the paper a new distance measure for training set
  selection is presented and thoroughly discussed. The distance between two datasets
  is computed using variance of entropy in groups obtained after clustering. The approach
  is validated using real domain datasets from debt portfolio valuation process. Eventually,
  prediction performance is examined.
