abstract: Social networks influence health-related behavior, such as obesity and smoking.
  While researchers have studied social networks as a driver for diffusion of influences
  and behavior, it is less understood how the structure or topology of the network,
  in itself, impacts an individual's health behavior and wellness state. In this paper,
  we investigate whether the structure or topology of a social network offers additional
  insight and predictability on an individual's health and wellness. We develop a
  method called the Network-Driven health
