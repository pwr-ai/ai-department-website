abstract: In the paper, the method of short word deletion errors correction in automatic
  speech recognition is described. Short word deletion errors appear to be a frequent
  error type in Polish speech recognition. The proposed speech recognition process
  consists of two stages. At the first stage the utterance is recognized by a typical
  speech recognizer based on forward bigram language model. At the second stage the
  word sequence recognized by the first stage recognizer is analyzed and such pairs
  of adjacent words in the recognized
