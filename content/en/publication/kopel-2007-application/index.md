abstract: Web is the boundless source of information and no one is able to process
  the vast amount of new documents published on the web every day, even with filtering
  out the documents the user is not interested in. However, most of the recent web
  documents are blog posts, news and other documents with the author information established.
  Each author who is also the receiver of web documents possesses their own personal
  agent that delivers trust information related to other authors as well as rank data
  for each new document. Trusts and
