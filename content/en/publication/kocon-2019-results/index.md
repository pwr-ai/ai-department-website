abstract: This article presents the research in the recognition and normalization
  of Polish temporal expressions as the result of the first PolEval 2019 shared task.
  Temporal information extracted from the text plays a significant role in many information
  extraction systems, like question answering, event recognition or text summarization.
  A specification for annotating Polish temporal expressions (PLIMEX) was used to
  prepare a completely new test dataset for the competition. PLIMEX is based on state-of-the-art
  solutions for English, mostly
