abstract: A common problem of the real-world data sets is the class imbalance, which
  can significantly affect the classification abilities of classifiers. Numerous methods
  have been proposed to cope with this problem; however, even state-of-the-art methods
  offer a limited improvement (if any) for data sets with critically under-represented
  minority classes. For such problematic cases, an “outside the box” solution is required.
  Therefore, we propose a novel technique, called enrichment, which uses the information
  (observations) from the external data set (s)
