abstract: In the paper, the architecture for a mobile medical decision support and
  its exemplary application to medicines prescribing is presented. The aim of the
  architecture is to provide the decision algorithms and database support for thin
  client applications running on low cost palmtop computers. We consider the wide
  class of medical applications, where decision making is equivalent to typical pattern
  recognition problem. The decision support consists in ordering the decisions by
  their degree of belief in the context, in which the decision is being
