 abstract = {The paper presents an attempt to use UML to model essential structural and dynamic aspects of multimedia data used in multimedia presentations. The proposed model defines a set of few fundamental basic concepts: logical data units, synchronisation point, stream, beam, movie and user interaction tools.

Moreover, the model allows description of both physical and logical},
