abstract: The advancement of science as outlined by Popper and Kuhn is largely qualitative,
  but with bibliometric data it is possible and desirable to develop a quantitative
  picture of scientific progress. Furthermore it is also important to allocate finite
  resources to research topics that have growth potential, to accelerate the process
  from scientific breakthroughs to technological innovations. In this paper, we address
  this problem of quantitative knowledge evolution by analysing the APS publication
  data set from 1981 to 2010. We build the
publication: '*arXiv preprint arXiv:1810.12116*'
