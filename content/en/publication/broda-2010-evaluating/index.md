abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation in text is still a difficult problem as the best
  supervised methods require laborious and costly manual preparation of training data.
  On the other hand, the unsupervised methods express significantly lower accuracy
  and produce results that are not satisfying for many application. Recently, an algorithm
  based on weakly-supervised learning for WSD called Lexicographer-Controlled Semi-automatic
  Sense Disambiguation (LexCSD) was proposed. The method is based on clustering of
  text snippets
