abstract: The construction of a wordnet from scratch requires intelligent software
  support. An accurate measure of semantic relatedness can be used to extract groups
  of semantically close words from a corpus. Such groups help a lexicographer make
  decisions about synset membership and synset placement in the network. We have adapted
  to Polish the well-known algorithm of Clustering by Committee, and tested it on
  the largest Polish corpus available. The evaluation by way of a plWordNet-based
  synonymy test used Polish WordNet, a resource
