abstract: In the paper three learning and inference ordering approaches in the method
  for structured output classification are presented. As it was previously presented
  by authors, classification of single element in output structure can be performed
  by generalization of input attributes as well as already partially classified output
  elements [9]. The paper addresses crucial problem of how to order elements in the
  structured learning process to get greater final accuracy. The learning is performed
  by means of ensemble, boosting classification method
