abstract: The Parameter-less Population Pyramid (P3) is a recent method proposition
  that includes the linkage learning mechanisms based on the Dependency Structure
  Matrix (DSM) clustering. P3 was shown to be effective for solving various hard theoretical
  problems. In this paper, we show that for problems built from the bimodal deceptive
  functions the effectiveness of P3 is low due to low quality of linkage information
  gathered by P3. Therefore, we propose the feedback operation that periodically copies
