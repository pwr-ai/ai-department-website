abstract: In this article we extend a WordNet structure with relations linking synsets
  to Desikan's brain regions. Based on lexicographer files and WordNet Domains the
  mapping goes from synset semantic categories to behavioural and cognitive functions
  and then directly to brain lobes. A human brain connectome (HBC) adjacency matrix
  was utilised to capture transition probabilities between brain regions. We evaluated
  the new structure in several tasks related to semantic similarity and emotion processing
  using brain-expanded Princeton WordNet
