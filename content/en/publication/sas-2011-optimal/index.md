abstract: In the paper, the method of acoustic model complexity level selection for
  automatic speech recognition is proposed. Selection of the appropriate model complexity
  affects significantly the accuracy of speech recognition. For this reason the selection
  of the appropriate complexity level is crucial for practical speech recognition
  applications, where end user effort related to the implementation of speech recognition
  system is important. We investigated the correlation between speech recognition
  accuracy and two popular
