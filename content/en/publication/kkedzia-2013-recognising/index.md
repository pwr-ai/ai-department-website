abstract: A method for the recognition of the compositionality of Multi Word Expressions
  (MWEs) is proposed. First, we study associations between MWEs and the structure
  of wordnet lexico-semantic relations. A simple method of splitting plWordNet's MWEs
  into compositional and non-compositional on the basis of the hypernymy structure
  is discussed. However, our main goal is to build a classifier for the recognition
  of compositional MWEs. We assume prior MWE detection. Several experiments with different
  classification algorithms were performed
