The problems described above call for principled, practical, and highly scalable graph mining methods, both theoretical and application-oriented. As such, our work connects to fields like linear algebra, distributed systems, deep learning, and even neuroscience. Some of our ongoing projects include:

Algorithms for multi-network tasks, like matching nodes across networks
Learning low-dimensional representations of networks in metric spaces
Abstracting or “summarizing” a graph with a smaller network
Analyzing network models of the brain derived from fMRI scans
Distributed graph methods for iteratively solving linear systems
Network-theoretical user modeling for various data science applications
We’re grateful for funding from Adobe, Amazon, the Army Research Lab, the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS), Microsoft Azure, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Trove.





The Department of Computational Intelligence was established on the first December 2014 in the structure of the Faculty of Information Technology and Management at the Wrocław University of Technology. The scientific and teaching staff of the Department consists of: two titular professors, four university professors, seven scientific and teaching assistants, one assistant professor, two assistants and several dozen research workers employed in projects implemented in the Department. The Department's independent staff are the promoters of 15 PhD students at the Faculty and the Doctoral Studies. The scientific activity of the Department covers the field of technical computer science, including many departments of modern computer science in the field of artificial intelligence - intelligent methods of data analysis, methods of machine learning, computational linguistics, machine vision, systems supporting medical decisions and solving practical problems, including soft and heuristic calculation methods. 

The following scientific groups operate within the Department:
European Centre of Linguistic Technologies (CLARIN)
European Data Science Centre (ENGINE)
Scientific Group G4.19 - language technology group
Machine learning group
Metaheuryst group
Biomedical informatics group
Emognition" group - research group on methods of identifying emotions
