The problems described above call for principled, practical, and highly scalable graph mining methods, both theoretical and application-oriented. As such, our work connects to fields like linear algebra, distributed systems, deep learning, and even neuroscience. Some of our ongoing projects include:

Algorithms for multi-network tasks, like matching nodes across networks
Learning low-dimensional representations of networks in metric spaces
Abstracting or “summarizing” a graph with a smaller network
Analyzing network models of the brain derived from fMRI scans
Distributed graph methods for iteratively solving linear systems
Network-theoretical user modeling for various data science applications
We’re grateful for funding from Adobe, Amazon, the Army Research Lab, the Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS), Microsoft Azure, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and Trove.
